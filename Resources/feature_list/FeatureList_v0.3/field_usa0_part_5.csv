The personnel companies on-base have been randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to offer participating service members 1 of the following 2 programs: either the educational video game (called the ""intervention""), or pamphlets on stopping tobacco use (called ""standard care""). Each company will receive only 1 of the 2 programs, and all participating service members in the same company will receive the same program. Each company has an equal chance of being assigned to either program.\n\nIntervention:\n\nParticipants in the intervention group will have a month to use the educational anti-tobacco video game located in areas that will provide convenient access. The game will be made available using an arcade-type kiosk which houses the computer game. After playing the video game on the kiosk for three 30-minute sessions, you will then be given a CD-ROM disc of the game to use as needed. After finishing these three 30-minute computer sessions, you will also receive a series of printed materials that go along with the computer sessions.\n\nStandard Care:\n\nThe standard care participants will receive a self-help pamphlet about stopping and avoiding tobacco use, provided by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nBoth Intervention and Standard Care Groups:\n\nNo matter which group your company is assigned to, if you choose to take part, you will be asked to complete surveys by computer at 4 points throughout the study. The survey will include questions about tobacco use, such as how much tobacco you use, how many times you have tried to quit, how ready you are to quit, how dependent you are on nicotine, any withdrawal and breathing symptoms you experience, your level of alcohol use, and support from family and friends. Each survey should take about 30 minutes to complete.\n\nThe first surveys will take place at the start of study participation.

0,12,['NCT01211990'],"['Background:\n\nThe number of individuals who choose to travel out of their native country for medical treatment in the United States has been growing (Purnell & Paulanka, 1998). State-of-the art care for children with cancer or rare diseases is not available in all countries, especially those where the ubiquity of cancer is a new phenomenon (Granda-Cameron, 1999). Due to the proximity of Latin America and the growing numbers of Latinos already in the United States, many, though not all, of the international patients being treated in U.S. hospitals are from Spanish-speaking countries (Coatsworth, Duncan, Pantin, & Szapocznik, 2006). While there are benefits associated with obtaining care in the United States such as improved access to specialized medical services, barriers posed by linguistic and cultural differences may play a role in the provision of adequate care for these children and their families. Additional challenges associated with receiving care in another country include failure to adhere to medical regimen due to breakdowns in communication, increased stress upon the caregiver to navigate a foreign health system and adjust to a foreign culture, and being uprooted from supportive social networks and family members (Flores, Abreu, Schwartz, & Hill, 2000). Parents of children with more severe and/or complex diseases may find themselves settling in the United States at the cost of leaving behind loved ones and careers in their country of origin. Provision of optimal care for these patients includes addressing the adjustment needs of their families; the caregiver-patient relationship has a significant influence on the child s physical and psychological outcomes (Brown et al., 2008). Exploring the experiences and needs of internationalfamilies that come to the United States seeking medical care for their child may help health care centers to provide more appropriate resources and may improve the overall quality of culturally-sensitive care provided to these families.\n\nObjective: This is a pilot, exploratory study designed to obtain greater understanding about the unique experiences of international families, mostly Latino families, who choose to participate in clinical research or seek medical treatment in the United States. Due to the lack of research on this phenomenon, the study will utilize qualitative methods to extrapolate the main themes that characterize this experience. The end goal of the study is to identify unique risk and protective factors that link directly to feasible interventions, so that we can provide this growing population with the standard of care expected by the mission of the NIH.\n\nAims:\n\nTo identify factors affecting the decision by international caregivers to seek treatment in the United States, with a specific focus on how medical information is obtained and utilized in the decision-making process.\n\nTo explore the experience of international caregivers in adapting to the medical and social culture of the United States.\n\nTo explore the thoughts and concerns of international caregivers regarding termination of treatment and subsequent re-entry into their native country.\n\nTo identify the presence and kind of positive growth experiences that occur in international families seeking medical care in the United States\n\nTo develop a set of concrete risk and protective factors associated with this experience in order to link to feasible interventions.\n\n(The term caregiver in this protocol is used to encapsulate any individual, such as a parent, close relative, foster parent, or head of household, who attends to the needs of the ill child.)\n\nStudy Population:\n\nThis is a study taking place at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). All caregivers of a child between the ages of 0-25 from a foreign country who have traveled to the United States for the purpose of enrolling in a research protocol and/or seeking treatment for their child s medical condition will be invited to participate in this study. Caregivers who immigrated to the United States for reasons other than obtaining these services for their child s condition will not be eligible to enroll in this study. Given the present demographic populations at NIH, it is expected that participants will include, but not be limited to, individuals from the Caribbean, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Chile, Peru, Guatemala, and Mexico. This sampling frame ensures that the presence of black, white, and mixed race individuals will be represented, acknowledging ethnicities that are often overlooked in studies focusing specifically on the experience of a given ethnic or racial group.\n\nSocioeconomic situation of the families is expected to vary widely; at NIH, individuals who meet the criteria for this study are from all different socioeconomic strata and have varying levels of education.\n\nDesign:\n\nThis is a qualitative study that will utilize narrative interview techniques to gather data, and content analysis techniques to analyze data.

0,16,['NCT02911155'],"['The field of nuclear medicine has expanded rapidly since its inception in the mid-20th century, with nuclear medicine technologists now potentially experiencing higher levels of radiation exposure relative to other medical worker populations. Many radiopharmaceuticals and procedures used in previous decades are now obsolete and are being replaced by new and emerging radioisotopes and combined-modality and molecular imaging procedures. While improvements in imaging technologies and the introduction of certain radioisotopes have generally reduced patient exposure to radiation, nuclear medicine technologists have become increasingly specialized in these newer procedures and are performing these and other nuclear medicine procedures with increasing frequency. Furthermore, lead aprons are less effective in protecting workers during nuclear medicine procedures, specifically higher-energy procedures (e.g., positron emission tomography (PET)), compared to other radiation-related procedures, and are seldom used by technologists performing nuclear medicine. As a result, cumulative doses to nuclear medicine technologists are expected to have increased. We hypothesize that certified nuclear medicine technologists may experience higher risks of some radiation-related cancers and other adverse health outcomes compared to most other medical specialty groups. There is currently very little information about radiation-related risks associated with performing these procedures due, in part, to limited information on occupational doses associated with current nuclear medicine practices. To characterize organ-specific doses that could later be used to quantify risks for specific radiation-related disease outcomes, either directly (through subsequent follow-up) or indirectly (through risk projection methods), we plan to collect detailed work history information on nuclear medicine procedures and associated radiation safety practices, as well as badge doses, for a representative sample of 1,500 technologists certified in nuclear medicine in the U.S. This information will complement similar data collected in 2013-2014 from an independent sample of approximately 4,500 general radiologic technologists in the U.S. Radiologic Technologists Study (USRT) who had reported working with these procedures.

Repeated P. falciparum infections in endemic areas induce protective immunity, thus providing optimism that an effective malaria vaccine can be developed. Key to the development of such a vaccine is an understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying protection and the longevity of these responses in the absence of continuous P. falciparum exposure. Anecdotal evidence suggests clinical immunity to malaria wanes within months to years after an immune individual leaves an endemic area.

However it would be impossible to do so with the continued use of CII therapy. Therefore, we propose to employ intensive subcutaneous insulin therapies and oral hypoglycemic agents to affect continued tight glycemic control following discontinuation of CII and continue such therapy beyond hospital discharge for a period of at least one year.\n\nWe hypothesize that this will lead to further reductions in major adverse cardiac outcomes in the high-risk diabetes coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) subgroup. The optimal method to test this hypothesis is with a very large, multi-center clinical trial. However, before embarking on such a resource-consuming endeavor, we intend to test the concepts, methods, implementation strategies, patient acceptability and compliance, proposed biomarkers and clinical outcomes of such a trial with this proposed limited pilot study.\n\nIf the information obtained from this pilot study is favorable, we will submit for full funding of the multicenter USCDP clinical trial to the NIDDK and NHLBI divisions of the NIH.

0,31,['NCT00341588'],"['The incidence of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) has increased during the better part of the twentieth century and is of particular concern as it primarily affects young men. Though the tumor is relatively infrequent in the population as a whole, TGCT is the most common cancer among U.S. males in the age group 15-34 years. Despite the increases in TGCT rates, the etiology is still poorly understood. The only well described risk factors for TGCT are cryptorchism, family history of TGCT and personal history of TGCT. Therefore, in order to understand better the environmental and genetic determinants of TGCT risk, a case-control study will be conducted among members of the U.S. Armed Forces. The study will include men who have donated a blood sample to the Department of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR) between the years 1989 and 2003. All DoDSR donors who have developed GCT will be matched to DoDSR donors who have not developed TGCT.\n\nA total of 1682 servicemen were enrolled in the study; 754 cases and 928 controls. Of these participants, 1303 men (77%, 590 cases, 713 controls) donated buccal cell samples.

The DoDSR serum samples have been assayed for levels of organochlorines pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl congeners, insulin-like growth factors and gonadotropins and steroid hormones. DNA isolated from the buccal cell specimens have thus far been genotyped for polymorphysms in the hormone metabolism and immune function pathway, immune function pathway, insulin-like growth factor pathway and for single nucleotide polymorphisms in the 8q24 locus.

0,32,['NCT04562636'],"[""Excess consumption of red and processed meat is a growing problem, especially in the United States where meat is consumed more than three times the global average. Epidemiological evidence for the association between excess meat intake and negative health outcomes (such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes) as well as negative environmental impacts (such as pollution, overuse of resources, and carbon emissions) indicates that reducing meat consumption should be particularly pertinent to researchers and other public health professionals.\n\nThe potential of using widespread communication campaigns, such as Meatless Monday, to reduce meat consumption by educating individuals on the associated health and environmental risks appears to be promising. However, the current literature is missing information regarding what types of messages are most effective (e.g. negative environmental messages vs. negative health messages). To address this knowledge gap, our study will collect quantitative data in measurable outcomes to understand effectiveness and comprehension of environmental messages and health messages to reduce meat consumption.\n\nSetting: This is an online study using Qualtrics, so this research does not involve talking to human participants.\n\nRecruitment: Participants will be recruited through Prime Panels, a survey research firm through which participants voluntarily sign up to participate in research studies.\n\nInformed Consent: Participants will read a written consent document that includes information about the study's purpose, expectations, and possible risks and benefits.

0,33,['NCT03924505'],"['The purpose of this study is to understand and improve naloxone implementation within Syringe Service Programs (SSPs) to reduce opioid overdose mortality in the United States. To achieve this goal, we will implement an external facilitation intervention that has been shown to improve implementation in HIV service settings. The intervention will leverage a naloxone implementation expert who will work with SSP organizational directors to identify barriers to and facilitators of achieving naloxone implementation quality and maximizing reach. We propose to assess the effectiveness of external facilitation, compared to dissemination of an implementation manual, in a national sample of SSPs in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Our proposed specific aims are as follows:\n\nAim 1: To characterize United States syringe service programs along the exploration, preparation, implementation and sustainment (EPIS) continuum for delivering naloxone.\n\nAim 2: To test the effectiveness of external facilitation + dissemination of the naloxone implementation manual, compared with dissemination of the naloxone implementation manual alone, to improve the advancement of naloxone along the EPIS continuum among United States syringe service programs.\n\nHypothesis. The dissemination and external facilitation arm will be more effective in advancing naloxone implementation along the EPIS continuum between baseline and 12-month follow-up, than the dissemination-only arm.\n\nTo achieve these aims, 425 SSPs that are registered with the North American Syringe Exchange Network (NASEN) and /or receive information from harm reduction related web-based forums (e.g., online discussion groups, newsletters and listservs)will be asked to participate in an on-line cross-sectional survey and will be sent a hyperlink to the initial screening survey. We will use the on-line survey results to characterize the SSPs along the exploration, preparation, implementation and sustainment (EPIS) continuum for delivering the naloxone intervention (AIM 1).\n\nThe on-line survey includes a set of questions designed to collect information to evaluate where the SSP falls along the EPIS continuum for naloxone delivery. SSPs in the Implementation (I) phase of the EPIS continuum (estimated n = 100) will be contacted by research staff and offered the opportunity to participate in the RCT. SSPs that are interested in participating in the RCT will be enrolled in the study. For those SSPs who agree to participate, study staff will confirm eligibility by reviewing and documenting responses to the screening survey.\n\nFollowing informed consent procedures, the study staff will administer the baseline survey to the SSP representative. The baseline survey will include questions about programmatic capacity, organizational culture, potential for internal champion or leader, perceived need for naloxone distribution within their community, and community acceptance of peer naloxone distribution programming. The study staff will then randomize SSPs into one of the one of the two study arms: (1) dissemination of the implementation manual and external facilitation for 12 months (experimental arm; n=50) and (2) dissemination of the implementation manual only (control arm; n=50).\n\nAll SSPs enrolled in the RCT will be sent a copy of the naloxone implementation manual either via email, hyperlink or the U.S. postal service depending on the preference of the participant. Those SSPs in the experimental arm will be enrolled in the EF intervention during which they will work directly with an OC to advance naloxone delivery as far along the EPIS continuum as possible during a 12-month period. The intervention will be delivered via phone calls, web-enabled audio and screen-sharing technology, and site visits. The key activities of the EF intervention include, initial SSP engagement, knowledge enhancement, capacity assessment, information gathering, identification of barriers and facilitators, development of action plans and provision of feedback, identification of funding and linkage to resources, and training of SSP staff.\n\nAt the end of the 12-month intervention period, SSPs in both study arms will participate in a follow-up survey, conducted by study staff, to evaluate advancement of naloxone implementation along the EPIS continuum.']",[],[],[],[],['Inclusion Criteria:\n\nSSPs that participate in the on-line screening survey and fall into the implementation phase of the EPIS continuum will be recruited into the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n-'],['100'],['Anticipated'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]

Current RA treatment emphasizes: 1) the need for early and aggressive treatment, and 2) the use of a treat-to-target approach. However, patients often struggle with treatment decisions, especially when the options have both benefits and risks. To address this challenge, investigators based at Arthritis Research Canada have previously developed an online decision aid called ANSWER-2 (ANimated, Self-serve, WEb-based, Research Tool: Version 2) for RA patients who are considering a biologic, and this tool has been recently adapted for the US healthcare setting (called US-ANSWER-2).\n\nObjectives: 1) To evaluate the effectiveness of US-ANSWER-2 in reducing patients' decisional conflict. 2) To assess the extent to which US-ANSWER-2 improves patients' knowledge about RA medications and confidence in managing their health. 3) To examine the experiences of patients and rheumatologists in using US-ANSWER-2.\n\nThe investigators will conduct a proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial with 80 patients with RA. Eligible individuals are those: 1) with a diagnosis of RA from a rheumatologist, 2) whose rheumatologists have recommended initiating a biologic or switching to another biologic, and 3) who have internet access and email.

Most of the losses are due to doctors being forced to curtail elective procedures and office visits as Americans were ordered to stay home during the height of the national health emergency.\n\nAs Physicians were able to return to work in the early Summer, even if only partially, many had to adjust to the newer medical practice of telehealth, and the lower revenues that came with it. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) gave assurances to Physicians that Medicare would reimburse telehealth encounters at 100% of the office visit rate. But private Payers were under no such obligation. Across the country, Physicians are reporting that they're being reimbursed at about 70% of an office visit rate despite the fact that telehealth requires both resources and expertise to implement effectively, and each encounter takes up to twice as long as an office visit.\n\nAdding to financial hardships, Physicians across the nation are reporting that legitimate insurance claims are being held up and denied by the insurance companies at a higher rate than ever, cutting off the cash that they need so desperately. As of June 1, only half of Physician practices say they have enough cash to stay open for another month.\n\nIn just 2 months in the spring of 2020, over 45 million Americans lost their jobs and for many, that also meant the loss of their employment-related health insurance. Despite shedding a massive number of members from their rolls, health insurance companies are actually predicting record profits for 2020. The pandemic it seems, is very good indeed for the health insurance business. Private investors and executives are taking huge dividends and bonuses out of the system just at a time when US healthcare needs a vast new investment of healthcare resources into the system. The good fortune of a few individuals and corporations comes at an as yet untold expense to American society.\n\nThe formula for insurance company success in a pandemic only happens one way. By keeping member premiums, delaying payments, and denying treatment authorizations, the large health insurance companies are taking advantage of the profound misfortunes of both doctors and patients during a national health emergency.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic will have adverse effects on the health of Americans that will be sprawling and long-felt. However, it is not for this study to decide whether private interests will always be antithetical to public interests when it comes to healthcare. That is a public debate that will continue to evolve as the profound weaknesses of the American way of distributing healthcare are magnified and exposed in a time of social upheaval.\n\nThe investigators do know that in order to get a handle on the major damage we see occurring in real-time- and to inform that debate, it is first necessary to measure it.""]",[],[],[],[],['Inclusion Criteria:\n\nHealthcare Provider based anywhere in the United States who is eligible to submit claims to an insurance company on behalf of patients.\nTo agree to participate in this study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nAny condition that at the discretion of the principal investigator renders the subject ineligible to participate in this study.'],['100'],['Anticipated'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]

0,64,['NCT04229212'],"[""Participants This study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Cheng Kung University Hospital (IRB: B-BR-107-046-T). This single center study was performed between May 2018 and April 2019. All the 60 patients who were treated with a PFNA system (Depuy Synthes®, Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (II), Solothurn, Switzerland) were consecutively included. Patients were included in the study if they (1) had an acute (injury less than 2 weeks) proximal femoral fracture, classified as Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen (AO) 31A1, 31A2, and 31A3, (2) were treated with closed reduction or mini-open reduction, and (3) were followed-up for at least 2 weeks post-surgery. Patients were excluded from the study if they had (1) a history of muscular-skeletal disorder or inflammatory arthritis, (2) other combined injury, (3) a previous hip surgery, (4) an extensive open reduction of fracture site, (5) hemodynamic instability, (6) consumed non-steroid inflammatory drug, steroid, or morphine before treatment, and (7) abnormal preoperative laboratory data, especially anticoagulation data, including prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and platelet level. The investigators established a table of random numbers, which was readily generated by computer 15, and divided participants into the drained and undrained groups based on their arrival time to the investigator's hospital.\n\nSurgery procedure\n\nExperienced trauma surgeons performed all the procedures. General or spinal anesthesia was determined by anesthesiologist. All patients received a single dose of 1 g cefazolin as preoperative prophylactic antibiotic. All the operations were performed on a traction table in supine position under fluoroscopic guidance. Reduction was achieved with closed reduction or mini-open reduction, including percutaneous Kapandji procedure or a minimally invasive procedure using the cerclage wire passer (Cerclage passer, DePuy Synthes, Solothurn, Switzerland). The reduction was regarded acceptable if no significant varus malalignment of the proximal fragment (neck-shaft angle more than 15°) existed or if less than 10 mm of translation existed between the main fragments as described previously. After achieving reduction, the skin was incised 3-5 cm proximal to the tip of the greater trochanter followed by straight longitudinal incision in the fascia of the gluteus muscle. The gluteus maximus muscle was split using the blunt dissection technique to gain access to the tip of the trochanter, which was followed by the insertion of the intramedullary guide wire. A protection drill sleeve was used to the trochanter and progressive reaming was performed until the diameter was 1 mm greater than that of the selected nail. After proximal reaming up to 16 mm, nail was manually inserted up to an adequate depth under fluoroscopic guidance, which was followed by positioning of blade guide wire. The blade was positioned in the center or distal third of the femoral neck on the anteroposterior view and in the middle third of the femoral neck on the lateral view. The blade was inserted and locked with the closure of fracture gap that was followed by application of a distal screw with gig and protection sleeve. End caps were not applied in all the cases because nearly none of the implants were to be removed. In the drained group, a hemovac drain (Zimmer Biomet, Autotransfusion System [HAS], United State) was placed beneath the fascia of the gluteus muscle, surrounding the entry point of the nail at the fracture site. The fascia of the gluteus muscle was repaired with absorbable sutures, Vicryl 1-0. The duration of operation was defined as the interval between the initiation of reduction and the wound closure.\n\nPostoperative care All the patients received a prophylactic antibiotic therapy of 1 g cefazolin every 8 hours for 1 day after surgery. All wounds were covered with a surgical dressing only and wound care was practiced on postoperative days 1, 2, and 4. The drain was removed within 24 hours based on the drainage condition, except when more than 250 ml fluid was drained in 24 hours 2, 12. Hb and Hct were examined on postoperative days 1, 2, and 4. The criterion for postoperative BT was a hemoglobin level of less than 8 mg/dL or presence of symptoms indicative of hypoxia. To control postoperative pain due to the influence of different anesthetic methods, the investigators measured visual analog score (VAS) at rest from postoperative day 1. The basic regimen after surgery was a combination of oral analgesics, acetaminophen and etoricoxib. After receiving the combination therapy, if the VAS score was more than 5, the investigators administered a subcutaneous morphine injection for pain control.\n\nPostoperative rehabilitation All the patients were encouraged to mobilize as early as possible to prevent complications associated with immobilization. Passive rehabilitation, including passive range of motion of the affected lower limb and practice for sitting at the edge of the bed, was initiated on postoperative day 1. Partial weight bearing ambulation and rehabilitation with walker was commenced on postoperative day 2. The extent of weight bearing was adjusted by the surgeon based on the stability of the fracture and the physical strength of the patient. Morphine was administered to patients when required during the rehabilitation period.\n\nData collection One independent observer who was not involved with the treatment performed the clinical assessments and laboratory data collection during the preoperative and intraoperative periods and on postoperative days 1, 2, and 4 (during admission) and on postoperative day 10 for suture removal.\n\nPrimary outcome The investigators defined TBL and BT as primary outcome variables that were calculated in millimeter. TBL was measured using the Mercuriali's formula because of its accuracy, which was based on previous studies. Mercuriali's formula: TBL = blood volume (BV) × (Hct [preop] - Hct [POD 4] + transfused RBC [mL])\n\nSecondary outcome The clinical outcomes included body temperature, VAS (for pain assessment), opioid dosage (morphine equivalent), width of the injured proximal thigh (20 cm distal to the ipsilateral anterior superior iliac spine [ASIS]), wound condition, and the other laboratory data. The wound condition was assessed based on criteria described previously with specific reference to hematoma formation and wound infection. The severity of hematoma surrounding the wound site was classified into 3 grades as follows: none, moderate (ecchymosis without swelling), and severe (ecchymosis with swelling of the wound, resulting in tension on the skin sutures) [Fig. 2]. Wound infection was classified in 2 groups: superficial infection and deep infection. A wound infection was defined as superficial when 3 of the following symptoms occurred: fever, wound discharge, and wound redness, which usually could be controlled with antibiotic prescription. A deep wound infection involved the tissue beneath the fascia of the gluteus muscle and the implant, which usually required debridement or revision. The investigators recorded hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels on postoperative days 1, 2, and 4 as secondary laboratory outcomes.\n\nStatistical analysis The primary objective of the study was to determine whether routine drainage in PFNA fixation for ITFs is useful. Descriptive statistics, including estimated mean and standard deviation, for continuous variables and percentages and frequencies for categorical variables were tabulated and presented. Because the sample size of both the groups was small, a nonparametric method, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for comparing continuous variables and the Fisher's exact test was used to analyze the categorical variables. Box and whisker plots were used to demonstrate the BT and TBL distribution between the drained and undrained groups for intertrochanteric fracture treated with PFNA. All statistical tests were 2-sided and a p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analysis was performed with R version 3.6.1 for Windows. The investigators calculated the required sample size that would provide 90% power (α = 0.05) to the trial for detecting the difference in TBL and BT based on previous studies 12, 21.

0,69,['NCT01154296'],"[""An estimated 56,300 Americans are newly infected with HIV every year. In addition, of the more than one million Americans living with HIV, approximately one-fifth do not know they are infected. Identifying these individuals is among the biggest challenges for HIV prevention in the United States. Early diagnosis of such individuals, combined with prevention counseling and provision of health care, could decrease the spread of HIV and improve the survival of HIV-infected persons.\n\nThe recent introduction of rapid HIV testing offers a critical public health screening approach for facilitating earlier diagnoses of HIV infection. Rapid tests permit a sensitive and specific, fast, simple, minimally invasive, and cost-effective method to screen for HIV.\n\nProject Aware expands on the CDC's Project RESPECT-2 study that was an expansion of the RESPECT study (a randomized controlled trial conducted in STD clinics in the mid-1990s before the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy and before the advent of rapid testing). Project RESPECT demonstrated that a 2-session, client centered counseling session based on behavioral theory with HIV testing was superior to a program with HIV testing and information only. This project showed that the counseling arm had significant reduction of STIs compared to those in the information arm. However, RESPECT did not include men who have sex with men (who account for 53% of all new HIV infections in the U.S.) and did not examine the cost effectiveness of the intervention. RESPECT-2 did include MSM, but it only compared a 1-session counseling session with rapid testing to 2-session counseling with traditional testing and did not address the question of whether counseling and testing is more effective than testing alone.\n\nProject Aware combines the RESPECT-2 counseling approach by adapting the HIV Rapid Testing and Counseling in Drug Abuse Treatment Study (CTN 0032), a NIDA-sponsored randomized controlled clinical trial being conducted in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network (CTN) to sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics to provide important and timely data on the effect of counseling in high-risk populations tested in health care settings. In this adaptation of CTN 0032, we will assess the relative effectiveness of (1) on-site HIV rapid testing with brief, participant-tailored prevention counseling vs. (2) on-site HIV rapid testing with information only (as recommended in the CDC guidelines). Secondary outcomes are reduction of sexual risk behaviors, substance use during sex (i.e., being under the influence during sex) and cost and cost effectiveness of counseling and testing. Participants (approximately 5,000 from 9 STD clinics) will be assessed for STIs, HIV testing history and sexual and drug use risk behaviors at baseline and at 6-months follow-up. The battery of STI tests will screen for Neisseria gonorrhea (GC), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Trichomonas vaginalis, Herpes Simplex 2 (HSV-2) and Treponema pallidum (syphilis). HIV test results that yield a reactive result will receive a confirmatory HIV blood test that day, with results delivered 5-10 days later. All participants will be randomized into one of two arms: Group 1- HIV testing and brief, client-centered counseling or Group 2- HIV testing and information only. Group 1 will receive a rapid HIV test with brief prevention counseling that addresses risk reduction based on an evidence-based counseling approach (RESPECT-2 counseling), while Group 2 will receive a rapid HIV test with information only.\n\nThe primary outcome will be analyzed using logistic regression for the binary outcome, new diagnoses of STIs (Yes/No). The logistic regression analysis will predict 6-month STI incidence as a function of randomization group controlling for the baseline incidence of STI. ANCOVA will be used for the secondary continuous outcomes, number of sexual risk behaviors and number of sexual episodes involving substance use.

Prostate cancer is the leading cancer affecting veterans and the second leading cancer among all Americans. The causes of prostate cancer and, particularly, the reasons for the unusually high incidence rates in African-Americans remain obscure. Dietary factors likely play a role in fatal cases, while hormones are also important in regulating prostate cancer growth. Dr. Charles Huggins recognized this effect in the 1940's, with androgen deprivation remaining as the cornerstone of therapy for advanced disease. Despite the strong circumstantial evidence, neither epidemiologic studies nor basic sciences have produced clear insight into the etiologic role of hormones. However, recent observations regarding androgen receptor gene polymorphisms and their relation to endocrine expression and prostate cancer risk may be providing important clues as to how an etiologic role might be mediated at the molecular level. Thus, it is important to attempt to identify genetic markers of high-risk cancer patients for necessary screening and counseling efforts.\n\nIt has been recently demonstrated that the androgen receptor functions as a ligand-dependent transcriptional regulator, and that this regulation is important in controlling prostate growth and apoptosis. Heightened androgenic stimulation, a potential by-product of shortened CAG repeat length, could potentially increase the risk of prostate cancer development and progression. In particular, a shorter CAG repeat sequence may be associated with cancers that have features of higher histologic grade, extraprostatic extension, and distant metastases (stage C or D). Recent evidence indicates that men with shorter CAG repeats are at particularly higher risk for distant metastatic and fatal prostate cancer. The results demonstrated that a shorter CAG repeat sequence in the androgen receptor gene predicted higher grade and advanced state of prostate cancer at diagnosis, metastatic disease, and mortality. However, these studies have been limited to whites since only a small number of African American men with prostate cancer were included.\n\nProstate cancer incidence varies between African-American and white men. African-American men have the highest known incidence rates in the world, 66% higher than white men in the U.S. The genetic findings described above raise the possibility that racial differences in the distribution of androgen receptor polymorphisms may account for the higher rate of prostate cancer, the more advanced disease, and the younger age at presentation in African-Americans.\n\nThis study created a cohort of prostate cancer patients who are well characterized with respect to histology, stage of diagnosis, and (over time) mortality. This study is generating data regarding the length of the CAG repeat sequence occurring in the androgen receptor gene and major prostate cancer prognostic determinants (histologic grade and state) at the time of diagnosis in black and white veterans. CAG repeat lengths on the androgen receptor gene were evaluated for a cohort of 145 African American and 150 white veterans with prostate cancer.\n\nResults: Mean androgen receptor gene CAG repeat lengths for Caucasians was 21.9 versus 19.8 for African Americans, p=0.0001. However, a truncated CAG repeat length (CAG <= 18 versus CAG > 18) was not associated with advanced stage of cancer at diagnosis, higher PSA at diagnosis, or higher Gleason score (each with p>0.5).\n\nConclusion: The mean androgen receptor CAG repeat length was 2 repeats shorter for African American versus white prostate cancer patients. These findings raise concern that prostate cancers in African American men may be less sensitive to hormonal therapy than those in white men. These findings provide biologic rationale for clinical trials that evaluate the joint administration of chemotherapy and hormone therapy for African American men with advanced prostate cancer.""]",[],[],[],[],['Veterans who undergo prostate biopsy where biopsy results are positive or PSA less than 10Ng/ml.'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]

EFs comprise a complex, multi-faceted brain system necessary to pay attention, overcome habitual and automatic behaviors, regulate mood, and ensure that current behavior is in line with short and long-term goals.Yet, protracted periods of high uncertainty, high demands, and high stress can lead to decreases in the efficiency and availability of EFs. Given the high demands and psychological vulnerabilities that U.S. Army personnel may face, it is critical to provide them with training programs to protect against degradation of EFs (particularly attention and working memory) over high-stress, high-demand intervals. Prior research on mindfulness training (MT) in civilians and military servicemembers showed that MT can effectively protect against degradation in attention and working memory and benefit psychological well-being over high-demand intervals.\n\nProblem: While being successful, prior MT programs required a considerable amount of time dedicated to training (e.g., 24-hour training) and it is challenging to integrate these long programs into the busy schedule of the U.S. Army personnel.

Use of shade is recommended by health authorities worldwide. However, shade provision requires expensive physical environment changes and may be effective only when health education has created a social environment (e.g., norms) that motivates its use. A multi-national research team will explore the use of built shade in passive recreation areas (i.e., areas for sitting/ standing while socializing, preparing/eating a meal, watching/coaching sports, watching a concert, taking a class, or waiting, or areas where people stroll for sightseeing, while observing outdoor displays, or shopping) within public parks and compare use between the United States (i.e., Denver, Colorado) and Australia (i.e., Melbourne, Victoria) to prospectively test the moderating influence of social environment on the built environment. Pilot studies confirmed that adults in Melbourne had stronger sun protection habits and norms than adults in Denver. The specific aims of the project are to: a) introduce built shade structures (i.e., shade sails) in public parks in Denver and Melbourne; b) compare the use of passive recreation areas with and without built shade; c) compare the change in use of the passive recreation areas in Denver and Melbourne after introduction of built shade, and d) examine the relationship among social environment and physical features of the environment and built shade.The research team will build shade sails at passive recreation areas in public parks and compare use of the passive recreation areas to unshaded passive recreation areas in a randomized pretest-posttest controlled design. Passive recreation areas will be enrolled in one of three annual sample waves and stratified by location (72 in Denver and 72 in Melbourne). In each wave, passive recreation areas will be pretested in a first summer, further stratified based on baseline use, and randomized following pretest to construction of a shade sail or an untreated control group in a 1:3 ratio. Posttesting will occur the following summer, after construction of the shade sails. In total, 36 passive recreation areas will be randomized to the intervention group with shade sail construction (18 per city) and 108 passive recreation areas to the untreated control group with no shade sails (54 per city). The primary outcome measure will be use of the passive recreation areas, observed by trained research assistants. The secondary outcome measure will be the potential ultraviolet radiation exposure, assessed by hand-held meters during the observations of the passive recreation areas. Data collection will occur during 30-minute periods between 11 am and 3 pm on on 4 weekend days over 20-weeks in the summer.

Participating facilities will be offered vaccine education for residents and staff, but will be randomly allocated to receive aTIV (FLUAD) vaccine or usual care (TIV) vaccination for their residents.\n\nBACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRI), including pneumonia, bronchitis, and tracheobronchitis, is the leading cause of infectious mortality and hospitalization in older adults , and nursing home (NH) residents. Pneumonia and infection often produce attenuated signs and symptoms in older adults, leading to delayed or even misdiagnosis for this population. Diagnosis is further compromised due to few and sporadic clinician visits with nursing home residents, and reduced access to radiology. LRI may or may not directly lead to hospitalization, but LRIs are associated with considerable other morbidity than can result in hospitalization, including exacerbation of underlying cardiopulmonary diseases. Hospitalization rates for NH residents vary considerably between facilities, but the majority of hospitalizations occur during the 12 weeks during which influenza peaks each year.\n\nOBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to estimate the differences in hospitalization rates during influenza season experienced by long-stay nursing home residents, between facilities using adjuvanted trivalent vaccine vs. standard trivalent vaccine.

There are several recommended CRC screening tests, including fecal occult blood test (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, air-contrast barium enema, and colonoscopy. In the VA, FOBT is the predominant screening test for CRC. Numerous randomized controlled trials have established the efficacy of FOBT in CRC screening. Its advantages include privacy, noninvasiveness, and cost-effectiveness. Use of guaiac-based testing, however, is hampered by low patient compliance, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. The poor patient compliance, and low specificity and positive predictive value, may be related to the testing procedure. For example, dietary and medication restrictions are recommended to decrease false-negative and false-positive tests. Such restrictions may impede patient compliance. Recently, several studies have evaluated the effectiveness immunochemical-based testing as a potential alternative, with reportedly better compliance, sensitivity, and specificity than guaiac-based tests.

The incidence of serogroup B meningococcal disease however is too low to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to determine the actual efficacy of the new serogroup B vaccines. Instead vaccine efficacy was inferred from serum bactericidal antibody responses using four test strains. However, because of strain variability of FHbp amino acid sequence (there are more than 800 sequence variants described) and strain variability of FHbp expression, bactericidal data on only four strains are unlikely to be sufficient to predict the actual strain coverage by the vaccine. There also are gaps in knowledge about the underlying mechanisms by which human antibodies to FHbp elicit complement mediated bactericidal activity. For example, binding of FH to FHbp is specific for human FH. Therefore in vaccinated humans the vaccine antigen is expected to form a complex with FH right after immunization. The investigators' hypothesis is that binding of human FH to the vaccine antigen skews the antibody repertoire to FHbp epitopes located outside of the FH combining site. The resulting antibodies would be expected not to inhibit binding of FH to the bacteria.

0,103,['NCT03293875'],"['The intervention framework of the proposed Intervention is exerting change at multiple levels, through community based approaches. At the structural level, the investigators propose to increase the access to HIV testing of high risk drug users and to create change at the community level regarding factors that influence the risk of drug users such as stigma towards drug use and HIV among other topics. At the individual level, the investigators propose to modify normative beliefs around risky behaviors in a social network and hence, effecting change in participants by changing normative behavior around safer sexual encounters, HIV testing, and reduced risk in injection and non-injection drug use. Following, strategies to be employed in each intervention component are delineated.\n\nSocial Network HIV Testing Component. To prepare for the rolling-out of the social network HIV testing component (during month 6 of year 2), the investigators will convene a two day training with partner organizations from both sides of the border to train staff on the social network referral methodology. Research staff will initiate the recruitment of seeds by recruiting four to six seeds per city. Counselors, at the partner organizations, will begin by administering a rapid HIV test and provide pre and post-test counseling to seeds. Counselors, who will be trained in the social network assessment methodology, will then ask seeds to list other drug users in their social network who they believe are at risk of contracting HIV. Counselors will then provide participants with 3 coupons to recruit identified network members for an HIV test. Referred participants who engage in high-risk behavior will be also provided with 3 coupons to refer their own network members for an HIV test. Whenever social network HIV testing rates slow, research staff will re-seed in the communities to begin the recruitment process again. Counselors will make appointments for all participants who test positive for confirmatory HIV testing at the respective local governmental health care institutions. A research staff will follow-up with HIV positive participants to engage them in care. Throughout the duration of the project, monthly meetings will be convened between research staff involved in the project to ascertain that procedures are being followed and retrain if the need arises. The social network component of the intervention will continue until month 12 of year 5.\n\nThe Peer Network Intervention. During month 1 of year 4, we will roll-out the peer network behavioral intervention. Two peer leaders will be selected from each city to deliver the intervention sessions. Eligibility criteria will be being former drug users, having extensive contacts, high degree of trust among peers, and motivation and demonstrated ability to work fixed hours. During month 12 of year 3, training sessions, in collaboration with partner organization, will be conducted to train peer leaders over the course of two weeks during ten training sessions lasting 3 hours per session. Peer leaders will be trained in the curriculum as well as in psychosocial theory as the basis for behavioral interventions, interactive group management, HIV risk reduction, effective instruction for role-plays, and social network recruitment methods. Peer leaders will recruit drug users they know who will be asked, in turn, to recruit other drug users in their networks. If this initial contact is unable to recruit network members, peer leaders will select other initial contact. Peer leaders will deliver the intervention to 300 drug users (150 per border city) in cycles composed of small social networks of 5-6 drug users. Four intervention cycles will be held per month and will consist of 3 consecutive sessions of 2 hours in duration delivered in the early afternoon. Peer leaders will be expected to comply with a fixed work schedule of 10 hours per week and will be asked to actively recruit social networks for each intervention cycle. Although we expect the specific information and roles plays to change based on the findings of our formative phase and our sessions of acceptability and feasibility with our CAB and coalition, the peer network intervention will have the following structure. The first session of the intervention will cover training in social contexts of risk and strategies to avoid them through role plays, techniques for harm reduction for injection and non-injection drug use, and available community resources to deal with substance abuse. The second session will provide information about HIV and Sexually Transmitted Diseases through games, didactic sessions, and exercises to rank the risk of contracting HIV from various behaviors, negotiation skills for condom use in situations of high risk such as exchange of sex for drugs. The third session will consist of training in advocacy and sexual rights and establishment of a personal and social network risk reduction plan. Ethnographers will be trained to document the process of delivery such as number of participants per intervention cycle. Research staff will attend one intervention session per cycle to assess intervention fidelity. Weekly meetings will be held with peer leaders and research staff to discuss problems, solutions, and planning of community wide events.\n\nCommunity-Wide Events. The community coalition in collaboration with the CAB and peer leaders will be asked to plan and convene educational meetings at the community level with drug and non-drug users to deliver information on topics such as drug use prevention and treatment, HIV and risk reduction skills, and other issues affecting the HIV risk of communities such as persecution of drug users by police, human rights violations, and sexual violence. They will identify experts on topics identified and invite them as guest speakers.']",[],[],[],[],['Inclusion Criteria:\n\nat least 18 years old\nhaving engaged in sexual risk in the last 3 months\nable to give informed consent\nreported to have used crack or heroin in the last 30 days\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nunder 18 years of age\nunable to give informed consent\nengages in disruptive behavior while participating in the project not using crack or -heroin in the last month\nnot reporting having engaged in sexual risk'],['1400'],['Anticipated'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]

The RFA was intended to support a broad and thorough quantitative exploration of the potential health benefits and costs of cholesterol-lowering from multiple perspectives.\n\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\nThe study added to the CHD Policy Model the capability to model the consequences of reductions in LDL cholesterol and increases in HDL/LDL ratios in the United States population. The CHD Policy Model was used for several studies, including: to compare the implications of using alternative epidemiologic studies as the basis for estimating the association between cholesterol levels and CHD risk; to derive cutting points for initiating cholesterol reduction, specific to age, sex, and CHD risk factors, and based on cost-effectiveness criteria; to compare the cost-effectiveness of specific targeted and population-wide strategies for cholesterol reduction; to incorporate the effects of treatments on quality of life, including both adverse effects of cholesterol-lowering drugs and reductions in CHD morbid events; and finally, to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of cholesterol screening, incorporating costs of screening, effects of measurement error on misclassification of patients, and variations in individual cholesterol levels over time.\n\nThe study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the ""End Date"" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.']",[],[],[],[],['No eligibility criteria'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]

As such, recent efforts have focused on providing antiretroviral pharmacotherapy to this population. However, there are a number of factors indigenous to non-Western HIV-infected patients that may alter their virologic, immunologic, and/or toxicologic response to antiretroviral therapy. Absorption, distribution, and clearance of antiretroviral medications may differ among patients residing in non-Western countries secondary to dietary influences, parasitic infection, and malabsorption. Genetic polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes (cytochrome P450; CYP) and drug transporters (i.e. P-glycoprotein) may also contribute to altered pharmacokinetics among these patients. The purpose of this pilot, hypothesis-generating study is (1) to characterize the pharmacokinetics of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine in a non-Western HIV-infected population (Kampala, Uganda) and in a similar cohort of HIV-infected individuals in the United States and (2) to compare pharmacokinetic parameter values between the groups. Twenty-five subjects from each site will participate. Subjects from the Ugandan site may participate regardless of their CD4+ lymphocyte count and viral load; they will be studied prior to the U.S. cohort. The U.S. group will be selected to include subjects that are matched by gender to their Ugandan counterparts. Subjects will have one pre-dose and two post-dose blood samples collected for the determination of nevirapine plasma concentrations. Samples will be analyzed using LC/MS-MS. Population pharmacokinetics parameter values (Cmax, Cmin, AUC, CL/F, Vd) will be determined using NONMEM(Trademark) and compared between groups.

0,120,['NCT01150695'],"['Francisella (F.) tularensis is the organism responsible for tularemia. The organism can infect many different vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, but mostly rodents and lagomorphs. Transmission to humans is generally via an insect vector, such as ticks, mosquitoes, and biting flies, or from handling contaminated animal products or carcasses. F. tularensis is a highly infectious bacterium, with human infection and disease occurring with as few as 10 organisms, and mortality rates approaching 30 percent if untreated. Clinical presentation of tularemia varies in severity depending on the virulence of the organism, the route of entry, the extent of system involvement, and the immune status of the host. Following an incubation period of 3 to 5 days, individuals have an abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, malaise, anorexia, and fatigue. The clinical presentation of the disease can include one or more the following forms: ulceroglandular (the most common form of the disease), glandular, oculoglandular, pharyngeal, gastrointestinal, pneumonic or typhoidal. This study is a Phase II, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, trial comparing the safety and immunogenicity of a Francisella tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) vaccine produced by DynPort Vaccine Company (DVC-LVS) to a LVS vaccine in use by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID-LVS). Study Group A will include 110 volunteers who will be vaccinated with a single dose of the DVC LVS product in one arm and normal saline (NS) control in the other arm on Day 0. Group B will include 110 volunteers who will be vaccinated with a single dose of the USAMRIID-LVS product in one arm and normal saline (NS) control in the other arm on Day 0. Both vaccines will be administered by scarification. Approximately 100 microliters aliquot will be withdrawn and placed on the skin, a bifurcated needle will then be used to puncture the skin 15 times through the droplet. The primary objectives are: (Safety): assess the frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) and Grade 3 and 4 laboratory values following vaccination with either DVC-LVS or USAMRIID-LVS vaccine; (Take): assess the frequency of ""take"" (defined as the development of an erythematous papule, vesicle, and/or eschar with or without underlying induration) following vaccination with either the DVC-LVS or USAMRIID-LVS vaccine; and (Immunogenicity): assess the rate of seroconversion following vaccination with either the DVC-LVS or the USAMRIID-LVS vaccine as measured by a tularemia-specific microagglutination assay.

Participants in the study described herein (Groups 2-4, n = ~60) will be exposed to ~50 hours of sleep restriction , after which time eight suction blisters will be induced on one forearm and immune responsiveness and skin barrier restoration time recorded. Participants will receive no nutrition intervention (Group 2), an immune-enhancing beverage and additional protein (1.2 g protein per kg body weight versus 0.8 g protein per kg body weight) (Group 3) or probiotics (Group 4), during and after sleep restriction to determine if nutritional approaches attenuate the loss of immune responsiveness. The results of this study will provide insight into whether nutritional supplementation approaches confer immune recovery. The investigators hypothesize that the suction blister immune response (during the 24 hours following blister induction) and time to skin barrier restoration will degrade after an imposed stress which includes~50 hours of wakefulness and constrained living; and, a diet supplemented with either protein and a multi-nutrient nutritional supplement OR probiotics will attenuate the decrements in suction blister immune responsiveness (during the 24 hours following blister induction) and time to skin barrier restoration in response to ~50 hours of sustained wakefulness and constrained living.""]",[],[],[],[],"['Inclusion Criteria:\n\n• Members of the Reserves, National Guard or active duty military personnel\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nUnder the age of 18 or over the age of 45\nHave a tattoo on both forearms\nAre taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., Advil), aspirin, lipid-lowering drugs or corticosteroids\nPegnant or lactating\nImune-compromised (e.g., chemotherapy or radiation treatment)\nSffering from an autoimmune disease (e.g., lupus)\nRcovering from a surgery within the past 6 months\nHave an injury that will prevent physical activity\nHave a history of cardiovascular disease\nAre suffering from sleep apnea\nHave a history of psychiatric disorder requiring hospitalization or have taken psychiatric medication (e.g., anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medication) within the past three years for any length of time\nAre suffering from any neurological disorder (e.g., epilepsy or other seizure disorder, narcolepsy or other sleep disorders, or multiple sclerosis)\nHave a BMI ≥ 30.\nFeel uncomfortable handling a weapon, shooting at silhouette targets, ave an injury that will impair firing a rifle\nHave ever been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder\nAre unable to distinguish the color ""red"" from the color ""black"".']",['63'],['Actual'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]

0,127,['NCT00005171'],"['BACKGROUND:\n\nIn 1985 when the study was initiated, there were surprisingly little data on the distribution of risk factors among subgroups of the population and the changes occurring over time. These issues assumed greater importance as the decline in coronary heart disease mortality focused interest on the role of primary prevention through alteration of risk factors. In review of the potential contributions to this decline, it was noted that cessation of cigarette smoking, better blood pressure control and decrease in total serum cholesterol may have accounted partially for the decline in coronary heart disease mortality. However, these observations overlooked the possibility that observations in the total population or confined to specific socioeconomic groups may fail to disclose differential changes in particular population segments. For example, Americans in the higher educational and income groups experienced rapid and marked changes in risk behaviors while less educated, lower income Americans or specific racial/ethnic groups experienced no beneficial changes. The majority of cohort studies followed rather select groups and most cross-sectional surveys also had little sociodemographic variability. However, focusing public health, educational and medical intervention efforts required that particular groups at greater risk or experiencing less beneficial secular change be identified and targeted for greater efforts.\n\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\nTrends in blood pressure, serum lipids, and cigarette smoking were described in nationally representative samples of adolescents ages 12 to 17 and in young adults ages 18 to 24 using data from surveys conducted from 1960 to 1984 by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Trends in blood pressure, serum lipids, cigarette smoking, and obesity were described in nationally representative samples of older adults ages 35 to 75 using NCHS survey data. The national surveys used included National Health Examination Surveys (NHES-I and III), the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES I and II) and Hispanic NHANES. The secular trends in these risk factors were contrasted by subgroupings of age, race, sex, family income, and education. The correlates of these risk factors were determined and secular changes over time were identified and quantified. Risk factor values and their correlates in the national population sample were contrasted with the three Hispanic populations surveyed in the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). Statistical methodologies were refined including statistical software for the analysis of complete sample survey data, model fitting strategies to characterize the secular trends across four national surveys, and guidelines for the choice of analytical strategies.\n\nThe study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the ""End Date"" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.']",[],[],[],[],['No eligibility criteria'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]

0,135,['NCT02829073'],"['BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE\n\nTinnitus, defined as the perception of sound when no corresponding external auditory stimulus exists, is a debilitating condition that is widespread yet difficult to successfully treat. It is estimated that between 10% and 15% of the adult population experience tinnitus to some degree. Although many people with tinnitus are not disturbed by the sensation, the condition is disabling in 0.5% to 2% of the tinnitus population or between 1.4 and 5 million people (Bauer & Brozoski, 2006). Additionally, tinnitus is among the most prevalent of service-connected disabilities for veterans receiving compensation according to the VA 2010 Annual Benefits Report, impacting over half a million veterans (US Department of Veterans Affairs, 2010).\n\nThe impact of tinnitus on a patient\'s quality of life can be devastating (Tyler & Baker, 1983). Many patients report that the intrusive perception of sound - such as ringing, roaring, or buzzing - interferes with their ability to relax, sleep and concentrate, especially in quiet situations. Many tinnitus patients also report reduced tolerance of loud sounds, and will tend to avoid noisy (e.g. social) situations. The disturbing effects of the condition can lead to a desperate sense of loss of control.\n\nUntil recently, there has been no treatment that has been clinically validated as consistently effective. Despite advances in understanding of the tinnitus condition, such as the Neurophysiological Model (Jastreboff & Hazell, 1993), the promise of much improved outcomes from treatment has yet to be realized in general clinical practice. Previously available treatment options continue to be limited by a lack of clinically consistent efficacy, efficiency, and/or user acceptability. Even Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT), the most widely advocated practical application of the principles of the Neurophysiological Model, has been recently reported to yield only modest outcomes, and to require an extended period of time (up to 24 months) to achieve these outcomes for a high proportion of patients (J. A. Henry et al., 2005). Notably, some reports (Dineen, Doyle, Bench, & Perry, 1999; Hiller & Haerkotter, 2005; McKinney, Hazell, & Graham, 1999; Schmitt & Kroner-Herwig, 2002; Tyler, 2004) have questioned whether the acoustic stimulation used in tinnitus management programs such as TRT, predominantly consisting of broadband noise generators or hearing aids, provides any real incremental benefit over the counseling component of the program.\n\nFurthermore, hearing aids and noise generators have been shown to provide limited clinical benefits when used in tinnitus management programs (Hiller & Haerkotter, 2005; Moffat et al., 2009), and these technologies are further limited by problems with user acceptability. Many tinnitus sufferers report that they find hearing aids intolerable to wear due to their decreased sound tolerance together with the unpredictability of amplified ambient sounds. Similarly, many people fitted with noise generators find the sound they produce unpleasant to listen to for the extended periods each day for which their use is recommended. As a result, for both hearing aids and noise generators, return-for-credit and ""left-unused-in-the-drawer"" rates are very high (J.A. Henry, Schecthter, Nagler, & Fausti, 2002; Hiller & Haerkotter, 2005).\n\nRecent research into the pathogenesis of tinnitus has emphasized the role of neurological changes that result from damage to the auditory system (Tyler, 2005). These changes include the brain\'s adaptive response to auditory starvation (leading to increased sensitivity in the system), the initial perception of sound, and the systems within the brain that determine the person\'s attention and reaction to it.\n\nThe Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment Program (NTTP) takes into account the neural plasticity that underlies tinnitus and targets the neurological changes that cause it. It utilizes an acoustic stimulus that combines music with an embedded neural stimulus, which are spectrally modified and customized for each patient\'s hearing and tinnitus profile. By accounting for a patient\'s hearing loss, the NTTP provides a broadband neural stimulus to stimulate the neural pathways that are ""starved"" due to auditory damage and/or hearing loss. The NTTP stimulus also positively engages the limbic system to reduce the stress caused by the tinnitus.\n\nA key benefit of the customization process is that it allows the stimulus to be used at a comfortably low listening level. By allowing for intermittent, momentary perception of the tinnitus within a pleasant and relaxing listening experience, it desensitizes the patient\'s reaction to the tinnitus, thereby leading to long-term reduction in tinnitus disturbance.\n\nThe NTTP has been clinically proven in civilian populations to : (1) reduce symptoms early in treatment, in particular, provide relief from the disturbing effects of the condition, (2) treat the neurological causes associated with tinnitus, (3) provide long-term relief and improvements in quality of life, and (4) be convenient and noninvasive.\n\nThe NTTP has been the subject of a series of published clinical studies with civilian subjects (P. B. Davis, 2005; P. B. Davis, Paki, & Hanley, 2007; P.B. Davis, Wilde, & Steed, 2002; P. B. Davis, Wilde, Steed, & Hanley, 2008; Hanley, Davis, Paki, Quinn, & Bellekom, 2008), which have demonstrated that it yields better results, more quickly, more consistently, and with an intervention that is more acceptable to the patient than prior approaches. Included among these clinical studies was a comparative study (P. B. Davis et al., 2008) that showed that the Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment generates significantly greater and more consistent improvements in tinnitus symptoms than a treatment comprised of counseling plus broad band noise (\'white noise\') and better outcomes than counseling-alone.\n\nWhile the efficacy of the NTTP has been demonstrated, it remains an expensive and somewhat time-consuming treatment strategy. A previous study (Karch, Hill, Casto, Nedostup, & Staton, 2014) indicated that a COTS sound therapy may also be an effective way to treat tinnitus. Preliminary analysis of subjective tinnitus measures from Karch (2014) indicates that the NTTP strategies were effective at reducing the negative effects of tinnitus (i.e. reduction in subjective effects of tinnitus as measured by the Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire (TRQ), tinnitus awareness time, and tinnitus disturbance time). Similar results were seen with a COTS group, with statistically significant differences in pre- and post-treatment measures of TRQ and tinnitus awareness. Analysis of clinical measures associated with tinnitus suggest no differences between pre- and post-treatment on the masking level required to cover tinnitus or the level of loudness discomfort associated with tinnitus for either group. However, due to the small sample size and unequal groups, comparisons between the treatments in the Karch et al. study (2014) should be made cautiously.\n\nMILITARY RELEVANCE\n\nTinnitus is among the most prevalent medical complaints soldiers have when returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom/ Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF). Soldiers with clinically significant levels of tinnitus often suffer from anxiety, depression, sleep disruption, and difficulty concentrating. Currently, there is no standard tinnitus treatment protocol in the military system and limited clinical efficacy on the NTTP and COTS tinnitus treatment supported by a controlled study. The proposed research will attempt to definitively establish the value of the NTTP in a military setting.\n\nThe study stresses the return-to-duty of Soldiers experiencing severe tinnitus that might otherwise prevent these Soldiers from deploying with their units. Retention of a fit force and improved quality of life for active-duty Soldiers are important issues associated with a successful approach to the treatment of tinnitus.\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS/RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nThe objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of individualized sound stimuli used in a FDA classified tinnitus masker device, the Neuromonics, Inc. Oasis™.\n\nResearch Question: Is there a difference in clinical outcomes for tinnitus patients treated with the NTTP compared with the same treatment using a placebo-control device?

0,153,['NCT02352532'],"[""Low back pain (LBP) is the second most frequent reason for health care visits and a leading cause of medical evacuation from theater. Traditional medical diagnosis based on static imaging strategies (e.g. MRI) has failed to improve management of this epidemic. Functional assessment of lumbar musculature using ultrasound imaging provides evidence of clinically relevant deficits in the lumbar multifidus (LM) muscle of patients with LBP, however such procedures are likely only valid within a narrow range of assessment conditions. Shear-Wave Elastography (SWE) is an evolving non-invasive ultrasound imaging technology capable of quantifying tissue stiffness (i.e., elasticity). Originally developed to improve diagnosis of soft tissue tumors, SWE is beginning to be used to as an alternative and more stable method of functional assessment of muscles.\n\nThis study will be the second project in a line of research aimed at improving the diagnosis, management, and treatment of patients with LBP using a new structural health monitoring technique called shear wave elastography (SWE). Since no previous studies had used SWE in the lumbar multifidus muscle, the initial project developed the measurement technique to be used with this device.

Inhibition of brain APA, which converts Ang II into Ang III, has emerged as a novel anti hypertensive treatment, as demonstrated in several experimental animal models. QGC001's anti-hypertensive effect is in part due to: 1) a decrease in arginine vasopressin release in the blood circulation, increasing diuresis, which reduces the size of body fluid compartment; and 2) a reduction in the sympathetic tone, leading to subsequent decreases in vascular resistances.\n\nThis study is an open-label, dose-titrating safety and efficacy study of QGC001 administered PO, BID, over 8 weeks in hypertensive overweight subjects of multiple ethnic and racial groups in the United States.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to assess the effects of twice daily (BID) administration of oral (PO) QGC001 (250 mg BID, 500 mg BID, and 500 mg BID + hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg once daily [QD]) on blood pressure (BP) over 8 weeks in hypertensive overweight/obese subjects of multiple races/ethnicities.""]",[],[],[],[],"[""Inclusion Criteria:\n\nSubject must provide signed written informed consent;\nMen and women greater than or equal to 18 years of age at Screening;\n\nDiagnosis of primary (essential) hypertension (HTN) for at least 3 months prior to Screening and have an office SBP:\n\nBetween 145 mmHg and 170 mmHg at Screening and are treatment-naïve; or\nBetween 130 mmHg and 150 mmHg at Screening and are treated with less than or equal to 2 anti hypertensive medications.

The study could enroll up to 323 patients to ensure 75 converted subjects with 6 months of follow-up data. Converted subjects were followed at 30-days, 3-months, and 6-months post conversion. Subjects that were unable to undergo conversion were followed at 6-months post filter implant (permanent filtration subjects).\n\nStudy subjects were to be identified from the pool of candidates with a time-limited risk for pulmonary embolism. Subjects who signed the informed consent were evaluated to determine eligibility for the study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Following completion of baseline procedures including a bilateral Doppler ultrasound of the legs to assess for baseline DVT and contrast venacavography to assess baseline IVC diameter, subjects underwent implantation of the VenaTech Convertible filter.\n\nAfter device implant, a clinical assessment was completed to determine eligibility for filter conversion. This assessment was done at an interval post-implant and frequency per the investigator's discretion, often with input from the primary care physician. If the clinician determined the subject was no longer at risk for pulmonary embolism, there was no thrombus in or below the filter, and there was no clinically significant deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the legs, the filter could be converted. After conversion, subjects were followed at 30 days and 3-months by telephone, and at a 6-months post-conversion office visit with imaging (KUB or spot film and Doppler or CT).\n\nIf during the conversion clinical assessment(s), the subject remained at risk for pulmonary embolism, additional conversion assessment(s) were completed per the investigator's discretion until the filter was either converted or the subject was determined to require permanent filtration.\n\nAt 6-months post-implant, if a study subject's filter had not been converted, no further conversion assessments were to be performed and no attempts were to be made to convert the filter as part of the study. The 6-month post filter implant visit was the final follow-up for nonconverted subjects, which also included imaging (KUB or spot film and Doppler or CT). The study protocol allowed the investigators flexibility as to the best IVC imaging modality based on the condition and anatomy of the subject.\n\nThe core laboratory reviewed all screening/baseline, filter implantation, conversion eligibility assessment, conversion, and 6-month follow-up images, with the exception of the ultrasounds. (The core laboratory recommended ultrasound images be evaluated by the expert sonographers at the sites).
