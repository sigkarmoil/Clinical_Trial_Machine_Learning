A recent literature review on avoidable rehospitalization of older persons in France cited studies on the topic and relied largely on ones from the US. Starting in 2013, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) 'Hospitals Readmissions Reductions Program' withheld up to 1% of regular reimbursements for hospitals with higher than expected (by CMS) rates of rehospitalization, within 30 days of discharge, due to heart attacks, heart failure and pneumonia. CMS increased this to 2% in 2014, will raise it to 3% in 2015 and may subsequently expand the list of conditions for which it will penalize early rehospitalizations.

Prostate cancer is the leading cancer affecting veterans and the second leading cancer among all Americans. The causes of prostate cancer and, particularly, the reasons for the unusually high incidence rates in African-Americans remain obscure. Dietary factors likely play a role in fatal cases, while hormones are also important in regulating prostate cancer growth. Dr. Charles Huggins recognized this effect in the 1940?s, with androgen deprivation remaining as the cornerstone of therapy for advanced disease. Despite the strong circumstantial evidence, neither epidemiologic studies nor basic sciences have produced clear insight into the etiologic role of hormones. However, recent observations regarding androgen receptor gene polymorphisms and their relation to endocrine expression and prostate cancer risk may be providing important clues as to how an etiologic role might be mediated at the molecular level.

Specifically, and reflecting the ultimate goal of clinical interventions - inducing functional recovery - the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM), has been recommended for further testing and development for use as a measure of functional ability in future SCI clinical studies. The SCIM is a very simple questionnaire and score sheet that an evaluator uses to determine how independently a person with SCI can perform certain tasks.\n\nA panel of SCI researchers recommended the SCIM as the most suitable among four candidate measures of functional recovery reviewed at a special meeting sponsored by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) at a joint meeting of the American Spinal Injury Association and the International Spinal Cord Society (ASIA-ISCoS) in Boston, MA, in June 2006. It was recommended that a large-scale, multi-center, prospective trial be conducted in the United States, which would mirror a recently published multi-site international study.\n\nThe proposed research on the SCIM III, the latest and most sensitive version of the SCIM, would test the hypothesis that the SCIM III is a valid, reliable, and sensitive measure of functional ability in persons with SCI. Twenty-two rehabilitation centers throughout the United States will enroll a maximum of 660 subjects. Functional ability will be measured with the SCIM III during the first week of admittance into inpatient acute rehabilitation and within one week of discharge from the same rehabilitation program.

The intervention will target active heroin and crack users and consists of increasing access to HIV testing via a social network HIV testing component and reducing sexual and drug use risk via a peer network brief behavioral Intervention. Encuentro also consists of conducting community awareness meeting to target structural factors affecting HIV risk. The intervention was developed in an area severely affected by violence and stigma towards drug users, El Salvador, which makes it particularly suitable for adaptation to meet the needs of drug users living in the proposed intervention site, the U.S.-Mexico border. The proposed intervention site also has been severely affected by violence which has curtailed any prior attempts to reduce the risk drug users' HIV risk. Violence has worsened structural factors which affect HIV risk such as, increasing police persecution and stigma and reducing access to resources. In our proposed project, we will engage in formative research to understand the context of HIV risk of drug users in the border region post violence and adapt the intervention accordingly. Findings will allow the investigators to tailor intervention components to meet the needs of drug users in the region. Subsequently, the investigators propose to test intervention effectiveness and evaluate implementation barriers and facilitators. To accomplish project aims we will use a mixed qualitative, quantitative approach. The investigators will begin with a formative phase by conducting in-depth interviews with drug users (n = 40) living in the region to understand how the context of drug use risk changed as a result of the violence and will administer a social network survey (n = 200) to characterize the configuration of risk networks. Findings will yield the necessary information to culturally adapt the intervention to meet the needs of drug users in the region and will help the investigators focus recruitment efforts where the riskiest networks are located. After the intervention is adapted with the help of the community advisory boards and the community coalitions, the investigators will implement the intervention and will assess the effectiveness and reach via 6 cross-sectional surveys administered to drug users (n=1,200). The investigators will assess the process of implementation by conducting ethnographic field notes of all intervention activities including community engagement and Community Advisory Board and coalition meetings. The investigators will assess the fidelity and quality of the intervention.

The occurrence of PTSD in the military is on the rise. This has significantly impacted military members, their families, and society as a whole. According to an expert panel convened by the Institute of Medicine in 2007, the effectiveness of most currently employed PTSD therapies is low. Safe and effective treatments are urgently needed. The specific aim of this investigation is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel approach to relieve PTSD symptoms, utilizing a procedure commonly used in pain management, a Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB) with local anesthesia. Male soldiers experiencing moderate to severe symptoms of PTSD will be recruited for evaluation of Stellate Ganglion Block with local anesthesia as an intervention for PTSD treatment. Participants will be randomized to receive either the SGB with local anesthesia to C6 tubercle or a sham procedure involving a subcutaneous saline injection to the neck. The PTSD symptoms before and after the procedure will be measured using a comprehensive clinician-administered scale, self-report measures, objective measures of cognitive ability, and physiologic reactivity measures. Subjects will undergo assessment prior to the procedure, one week following the procedure, one month and 3 months following the procedure. Patients receiving sham injections will be allowed to cross over to the treatment group. Based on published case reports of Lipov et al in Chicago and Mulvaney et al from Walter Reed Medical Center, who utilized this technique to successfully treat soldiers with combat-related PTSD, we predict that the use of Stellate Ganglion Block will result in reduction of PTSD symptoms as measured by clinician-administered scales, self-report measures, objective measures of cognitive ability, and physiologic reactivity measures, leading to a significant and lasting reduction of PTSD symptoms.']","['A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Stellate Ganglion Block in the Treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder']",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['April 2016'],['Actual'],['Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)'],"['D000010335', 'D000068099', 'D000001523']"

Thus, tinnitus caused by both long-term noise exposure and acute acoustic trauma is an obstacle to be overcome in return-to-duty decisions and represents a serious liability to the retention of a healthy and fit force. Until recently, there has been no treatment that has been clinically validated as consistently effective. The development of the Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment sought to overcome the practical limitations of previously available approaches (e.g. tinnitus maskers and biofeedback). While these studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment over alternative therapies, these trials studied target populations that may not be representative of the typical Soldier experiencing tinnitus.\n\nOne hundred and twenty (120) Soldiers or veterans with debilitating tinnitus will be recruited and divided into groups treated with two treatments, the Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment Program which includes the use of the Neuromonics Oasis™ treatment device and a similarly-treated device using a placebo treatment. The study uses a randomized, double-blind design. The effectiveness of the treatments will be assessed using standard audiometric procedures and tinnitus subjective questionnaires.\n\nThis study will allow the Office of the Surgeon General of the Army to provide direction regarding the Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment Program (NTTP) for alleviation of debilitating tinnitus that adversely affects Soldier deployability and operational performance.

The condition is most commonly diagnosed in the lumbosacral spinal segments L3-S1. The condition often starts with an injury to the disc space. The injury weakens the disc and creates excessive motion at the corresponding vertebral level. Over time, the segmental instability and associated neurological compromise combined with ongoing inflammatory processes that occur in and around the disc produce low back pain. The reparative processes in the disc are poor, thus the painful symptoms can become chronic.\n\nPremature degeneration at adjacent levels of the spine remains one of the more vexing problems facing spinal surgeons when advising relatively young people to consider lumbar fusion surgery. Stopping the motion changes the mechanics of the back (which is designed for motion and flexibility) and results in the transfer of the loads and stresses to the adjacent vertebral segments. It is therefore intuitive to pursue total disc replacement, which allows for the treatment of pain due to DDD while re-establishing motion and stability, load distribution, and restoring the disc height, as an alternative to spinal fusion surgery.\n\nThe study hypothesis is that military personnel receiving Total Disc Replacement will return to the same level of active duty performance as at the time of their most recent successful physical readiness test.""]",['Clinical Outcomes of Lumbar Degenerative Disc Disease in Active-Duty U.S. Service Personnel'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],['March 2011'],['Actual'],['Degenerative Disc Disease'],"['D000001847', 'D000009140']"
