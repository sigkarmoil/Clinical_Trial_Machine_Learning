D. Anderson Department of Behavioral Science are developing a new video game program for young U.S. Army service members. The game addresses stopping and preventing the use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Soldiers (ages 18-35 years) stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, who are not scheduled to be mobilized for a 13-month period, will be invited to take part in the study.

The Study Groups:

If you choose to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a type of study intervention. The personnel companies on-base have been randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to offer participating service members 1 of the following 2 programs: either the educational video game (called the ""intervention""), or pamphlets on stopping tobacco use (called ""standard care""). Each company will receive only 1 of the 2 programs, and all participating service members in the same company will receive the same program. Each company has an equal chance of being assigned to either program.

Intervention:

Participants in the intervention group will have a month to use the educational anti-tobacco video game located in areas that will provide convenient access. The game will be made available using an arcade-type kiosk which houses the computer game. After playing the video game on the kiosk for three 30-minute sessions, you will then be given a CD-ROM disc of the game to use as needed. After finishing these three 30-minute computer sessions, you will also receive a series of printed materials that go along with the computer sessions.

Standard Care:

The standard care participants will receive a self-help pamphlet about stopping and avoiding tobacco use, provided by the National Institutes of Health.

Both Intervention and Standard Care Groups:

No matter which group your company is assigned to, if you choose to take part, you will be asked to complete surveys by computer at 4 points throughout the study. The survey will include questions about tobacco use, such as how much tobacco you use, how many times you have tried to quit, how ready you are to quit, how dependent you are on nicotine, any withdrawal and breathing symptoms you experience, your level of alcohol use, and support from family and friends. Each survey should take about 30 minutes to complete.

The first surveys will take place at the start of study participation. The intervention group will complete the second survey right after finishing the program. The standard care group will complete this second survey at about the same time as the intervention group. Both groups will also complete the third and fourth surveys at 6- and 12-month follow-ups.

You will be asked to provide saliva samples at the 12-month follow-up visit. Researchers will use these saliva samples to measure the level of cotinine, a chemical in your saliva that is related to tobacco use. You will be asked to spit into a clean plastic container. A dipstick will be placed in the container for at least 30 minutes. After reading the dipstick and recording the result, the study staff will throw away the saliva sample right away.

You will also be told about the nicotine replacement therapy and other tobacco cessation services available at no cost through the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center (CRDAMC) Tobacco Cessation Program at Fort Hood. M. D. Anderson is collaborating with the CRDAMC Tobacco Cessation Program on this study.

This is an investigational study. Up to 2050 soldiers will be asked to take part in this study.",0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

KSHV is a newly discovered virus that is strongly associated with Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma. The high prevalence of KS and KSHV among HIV-infected homosexual men suggests sexual contact as a primary mode of transmission. Reports of non-sexual transmission in parts of Africa and the Mediterranean where Kaposi's sarcoma is endemic, and the identification of viral DNA in saliva and other bodily fluids, however, indicate the virus is also transmitted non-sexually. This study will:

Compare the prevalence of KSHV among different demographic groups in the United States
Examine the association between KSHV and high risk behaviors such as drug use (marijuana and cocaine), sexual behavior (age at first sexual intercourse and number of sexual partners), and medical risk factors (herpes simplex virus II, hepatitis B and hepatitis C)
Estimate the prevalence of KSHV in the United States.

Data and blood samples for the study will be taken from the NHANES III survey. NHANES is a program of periodic surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. The survey is designed to provide national estimates of health status for the United States non-institutionalized civilian population by means of household interviews, standardized physical examinations, and blood sample collection and testing. NHANES III-the seventh in a series of national examination studies-was conducted from 1988 to 1994.

This study will use the HANES data to identify risks associated with a KSHV-positive blood test in the survey population.

- State-of-the art care for children with cancer or rare diseases is not available in all countries. Owing to the proximity of Latin America and the growing numbers of Latinos already in the United States, many international patients receiving specialized medical care in U.S. hospitals are from Spanish-speaking countries. Although there are benefits associated with obtaining specialized care in the United States, linguistic barriers and cultural differences as well as the general stresses of caring for a child with a serious illness may affect families ability to obtain adequate care for their children. Researchers are interested in exploring the experiences and needs of international Latino families receiving medical care for their child in the United States in order to help health care centers provide more appropriate resources and improve the overall quality of culturally sensitive care.

Objectives:

- To understand the experiences of international Latino families who are receiving treatment for their child or have enrolled their child in a research study in the United States.

Eligibility:

Caregivers of a child between birth and 25 years of ages who are from Latin America (which includes Mexico, all countries in Central America and South America, and Spanish-speaking Caribbean countries) and who have traveled to the United States to enroll their child in a research protocol and/or seek treatment for their child s medical condition.
Caregivers must have a child enrolled on a research protocol at the time of this study.
Caregivers must have been away from their country of origin for a minimum of 3 months.

Design:

This study requires a single interview that should take approximately 1 hour.
Participants will complete the interview with a member of the research team who is bilingual or fluent in Spanish.
Participants will be asked open-ended questions about why they chose to come to the United States, how they are adjusting to living and getting medical care for their child in the United States, and what hopes they have for treatment outcomes and future medical care.
Researchers will record the interviews to be reviewed later. The recordings will be used for this study only.",An Exploratory Study of the Characteristics of and Challenges for International Families Seeking Medical Care in the United States,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"May 13, 2013",0,"['Cancer', 'Allogeneic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Prospective,0,"Background:

The number of individuals who choose to travel out of their native country for medical treatment in the United States has been growing (Purnell & Paulanka, 1998). State-of-the art care for children with cancer or rare diseases is not available in all countries, especially those where the ubiquity of cancer is a new phenomenon (Granda-Cameron, 1999). Due to the proximity of Latin America and the growing numbers of Latinos already in the United States, many, though not all, of the international patients being treated in U.S. hospitals are from Spanish-speaking countries (Coatsworth, Duncan, Pantin, & Szapocznik, 2006). While there are benefits associated with obtaining care in the United States such as improved access to specialized medical services, barriers posed by linguistic and cultural differences may play a role in the provision of adequate care for these children and their families. Additional challenges associated with receiving care in another country include failure to adhere to medical regimen due to breakdowns in communication, increased stress upon the caregiver to navigate a foreign health system and adjust to a foreign culture, and being uprooted from supportive social networks and family members (Flores, Abreu, Schwartz, & Hill, 2000). Parents of children with more severe and/or complex diseases may find themselves settling in the United States at the cost of leaving behind loved ones and careers in their country of origin. Provision of optimal care for these patients includes addressing the adjustment needs of their families; the caregiver-patient relationship has a significant influence on the child s physical and psychological outcomes (Brown et al., 2008). Exploring the experiences and needs of internationalfamilies that come to the United States seeking medical care for their child may help health care centers to provide more appropriate resources and may improve the overall quality of culturally-sensitive care provided to these families.

Objective: This is a pilot, exploratory study designed to obtain greater understanding about the unique experiences of international families, mostly Latino families, who choose to participate in clinical research or seek medical treatment in the United States. Due to the lack of research on this phenomenon, the study will utilize qualitative methods to extrapolate the main themes that characterize this experience. The end goal of the study is to identify unique risk and protective factors that link directly to feasible interventions, so that we can provide this growing population with the standard of care expected by the mission of the NIH.

Aims:

To identify factors affecting the decision by international caregivers to seek treatment in the United States, with a specific focus on how medical information is obtained and utilized in the decision-making process.

To explore the experience of international caregivers in adapting to the medical and social culture of the United States.

To explore the thoughts and concerns of international caregivers regarding termination of treatment and subsequent re-entry into their native country.

To identify the presence and kind of positive growth experiences that occur in international families seeking medical care in the United States

To develop a set of concrete risk and protective factors associated with this experience in order to link to feasible interventions.

(The term caregiver in this protocol is used to encapsulate any individual, such as a parent, close relative, foster parent, or head of household, who attends to the needs of the ill child.)

Study Population:

This is a study taking place at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). All caregivers of a child between the ages of 0-25 from a foreign country who have traveled to the United States for the purpose of enrolling in a research protocol and/or seeking treatment for their child s medical condition will be invited to participate in this study. Caregivers who immigrated to the United States for reasons other than obtaining these services for their child s condition will not be eligible to enroll in this study. Given the present demographic populations at NIH, it is expected that participants will include, but not be limited to, individuals from the Caribbean, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Chile, Peru, Guatemala, and Mexico. This sampling frame ensures that the presence of black, white, and mixed race individuals will be represented, acknowledging ethnicities that are often overlooked in studies focusing specifically on the experience of a given ethnic or racial group.

Socioeconomic situation of the families is expected to vary widely; at NIH, individuals who meet the criteria for this study are from all different socioeconomic strata and have varying levels of education.

Design:

This is a qualitative study that will utilize narrative interview techniques to gather data, and content analysis techniques to analyze data. Data will be gathered according to theories of saturation of content, while collecting sufficient data to ensure credibility and face validity (Mays & Pope, 2000). NVivo, a validated quantitative research tool will be used for data analysis.",0,0,0,0,"INCLUSION CRITERIA:

The field of nuclear medicine has changed a lot in the past decades. Technology has gotten better, so patients are exposed to less radiation. But now workers are doing procedures more often and using lead aprons less. So they may be exposed to more radiation. This may put them at higher risk for cancers and other health problems that are related to radiation. Researchers want to collect data from technologists to learn more about the risks and appropriate doses of radiation.

Objective:

To learn more about the risks and appropriate doses of radiation for nuclear medicine technologists.

Eligibility:

Adults who were first certified in nuclear medicine technology in the United States after 1980. They must be living in the United States. They must not be participants in the USRT study.

Design:

Participants will be recruited online.

Participants will complete an online survey. It will take about a half hour. This will have questions about their work with nuclear medicine procedures. There will be questions about the kinds of procedures and how often they do them.

Participants will give a short work history. This will include the names of current and past employers.

Participants will allow researchers to get records of their film badge dose readings. These will come from dosimetry providers.

Dosimetry data will not be shared with participants. Researchers can t ensure the how accurate or complete the data are.",Cancer and Other Disease Risks in U.S. Nuclear Medicine Technologists,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"May 1, 2020",Actual,"['Brain Cancer', 'Thyroid Cancer', 'Circulatory Disease', 'Breast Cancer']","['D000004701', 'D000009371', 'D000009369', 'D000006258', 'D000004700', 'D000013959', 'D000016543', 'D000009423', 'D000001927', 'D000002493', 'D000009422', 'D000010335']","['Endocrine Gland Neoplasms', 'Neoplasms by Site', 'Neoplasms', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Endocrine System Diseases', 'Thyroid Diseases', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Brain Diseases', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Nervous System Diseases', 'Pathologic Processes']","['BC04', 'BC10', 'All', 'BC17', 'BC19']","['Cancers and Other Neoplasms', 'Nervous System Diseases', 'All Conditions', 'Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Gland and Hormone Related Diseases']","['Brain Cancer', 'Thyroid Cancer']","['M3791', 'M3802', 'M15306', 'M15301', 'M6446', 'M7931', 'M6445', 'M10950', 'M17520', 'M3786', 'M4325']","['Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Thyroid Neoplasms', 'Thyroid Diseases', 'Endocrine Gland Neoplasms', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Endocrine System Diseases', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Brain Diseases', 'Central Nervous System Diseases']","['high', 'low', 'high', 'low', 'low', 'low', 'low', 'low', 'low', 'low', 'low']","['D000013964', 'D000001932', 'D000004194']","['Thyroid Neoplasms', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Disease']",0,0,0,0,0,0,Cohort,0,Prospective,0,"The field of nuclear medicine has expanded rapidly since its inception in the mid-20th century, with nuclear medicine technologists now potentially experiencing higher levels of radiation exposure relative to other medical worker populations. Many radiopharmaceuticals and procedures used in previous decades are now obsolete and are being replaced by new and emerging radioisotopes and combined-modality and molecular imaging procedures. While improvements in imaging technologies and the introduction of certain radioisotopes have generally reduced patient exposure to radiation, nuclear medicine technologists have become increasingly specialized in these newer procedures and are performing these and other nuclear medicine procedures with increasing frequency. Furthermore, lead aprons are less effective in protecting workers during nuclear medicine procedures, specifically higher-energy procedures (e.g., positron emission tomography (PET)), compared to other radiation-related procedures, and are seldom used by technologists performing nuclear medicine. As a result, cumulative doses to nuclear medicine technologists are expected to have increased. We hypothesize that certified nuclear medicine technologists may experience higher risks of some radiation-related cancers and other adverse health outcomes compared to most other medical specialty groups. There is currently very little information about radiation-related risks associated with performing these procedures due, in part, to limited information on occupational doses associated with current nuclear medicine practices. To characterize organ-specific doses that could later be used to quantify risks for specific radiation-related disease outcomes, either directly (through subsequent follow-up) or indirectly (through risk projection methods), we plan to collect detailed work history information on nuclear medicine procedures and associated radiation safety practices, as well as badge doses, for a representative sample of 1,500 technologists certified in nuclear medicine in the U.S. This information will complement similar data collected in 2013-2014 from an independent sample of approximately 4,500 general radiologic technologists in the U.S. Radiologic Technologists Study (USRT) who had reported working with these procedures. However, unlike the USRT sample, the proposed sample is expected to be higher-risk, including only those workers with a specialty certification in nuclear medicine who will have been begun working with nuclear medicine procedures much earlier in their career, at ages associated with greater susceptibility to radiation-related carcinogenesis.",0,0,0,0,"ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

A United States CTEPH Registry has been established under the guidance of a Steering Committee consisting of recognized physicians and scientists with expertise in CTEPH and related diseases. The mission of the Registry will be to promote a greater understanding of the prevalence, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of patients with CTEPH through shared information, education, and collaborative investigation among PH centers of excellence throughout the U.S. The development of a national CTEPH registry will be an important element in the advancement of the understanding of CTEPH and improvement in the care of patients who suffer from this debilitating disease.

All consecutive consenting patients recently diagnosed (< 6 months) with CTEPH at participating study sites will be enrolled. At the time of study entry, data on prior history and evaluation will be obtained from patient interview and review of medical records. Patients will be followed biannually after enrollment until the conclusion of the study (minimum of 1 year follow-up for final patients enrolled).

Much of the data gathered by the Registry will be presented as descriptive statistics. The Registry will seek the assistance of a biostatistician to develop a statistical plan for within patient and between patient cohort analyses.

Approximately 750 patients with newly diagnosed (< 6 months) CTEPH will be enrolled.

TIME FRAME:

Participants will be followed from the time of their enrollment until 1 year after the final patient is enrolled. Short term outcome measures and medical history will be collected during the initial visit, and clinical data will be collected from the initial clinic visits, hospital says, or procedures (if applicable). Patients will then be followed every 6 months after their enrollment for long term outcome measures on quality of life, functional status, and medical treatments.

DATA ANALYSES:

Demographics and Clinical Course:

Demographics, risk factors, time to appropriate testing and diagnosis, PAH targeted medication use, functional status, and hemodynamics at the time of enrollment will be provided annually as aggregate data to all investigators.

Evaluating Outcomes of PTE Surgery:

Descriptive statistics of the peri-operative data collected will be provided as aggregate data to all investigators annually. Immediate post-operative and longitudinal follow-up of all patients undergoing PTE surgery will also be provided as aggregate data annually to all sites. Comparisons of hemodynamics, functional status, medication and supplemental oxygen use and healthcare utilization will be made between the pre-operative data and longitudinal post-operative data.

Evaluating Predictors of Successful PTE:

Using longitudinal data collected on post-operative PTE patients, a definition of ""successful PTE"" will be established based upon hemodynamics, functional status and QoL. Retrospective analysis of pre-, peri-, and post-operative data can then be analyzed to identify factors that predict a ""successful"" or ""unsuccessful"" PTE surgery.

Evaluating Outcomes of Nonsurgical Therapy of CTEPH:

Predominantly descriptive statistics will be used to describe why patients are not operative candidates and the nonsurgical therapies (medication, balloon pulmonary angioplasty) used for treatment. Changes in hemodynamics, functional status, QoL and healthcare utilization on therapy will be provided as aggregate data annually.

Evolving Research Needs:

To adapt to the evolving science and research needs of the CTEPH community, separate analysis plans will be developed for new objectives identified and minor changes in the eCRF may occur in response to new diagnostics and treatments, if approved by the Steering Committee. Ongoing assessment of enrollment and data captured will also be performed by the Steering Committee to be certain the goals of the Registry are being met.

COMMITTEES:

A Steering Committee, chaired by Dr. Kim Kerr, is comprised of thought leaders in the areas of cardiology, pulmonology, and cardiothoracic surgery with expertise in CTEPH. The committee will have the following responsibilities:

Provide advice and guidance on the U.S. CTEPH Registry study design and protocol
Provide advice and guidance on the variables to be captured by the eCRF
Provide guidance on study sites selection
Review data results and provide insights into interpretation of the data annually
Provide input on the planning and organization of abstracts and manuscripts
Review abstracts and papers for submission to scientific journals or conferences
Present data at conferences

Although Medicare compares the rates of rehospitalization across the country, we have found no comparison of different countries. This is a first attempt to compare rehospitalization in the US with France where national health insurance (NHI) provides easy access to primary care but, like the US, policymakers struggle to improve coordination between hospitals and community-based health care providers.Although France's NHI system with central state intervention differs from the United States' tradition of federalism, private health insurance and pluralism, policymakers seek to achieve cost savings and to reform the health care system. A recent literature review on avoidable rehospitalization of older persons in France cited studies on the topic and relied largely on ones from the US. Starting in 2013, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) 'Hospitals Readmissions Reductions Program' withheld up to 1% of regular reimbursements for hospitals with higher than expected (by CMS) rates of rehospitalization, within 30 days of discharge, due to heart attacks, heart failure and pneumonia. CMS increased this to 2% in 2014, will raise it to 3% in 2015 and may subsequently expand the list of conditions for which it will penalize early rehospitalizations. Policymakers in France have been reluctant to implement a hospital pay for performance system based on a rehospitalization indicator whose validity is a subject of considerable controversy. Despite the controversy and differences in approach, a comparison of rehospitalizations between the US and France provides a cross-national perspective on a timely policy issue facing both countries.",Comparison of Rehospitalization Rates in France and the United States,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Individuals Hospitalized for Any Disease,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Cohort,0,Retrospective,0,"Data sources :

The hospital administrative data for this study are from the SNIIRAM (Syste'me National d'Informations Inter Regimes de l'Assurance Maladie) which also includes the national hospital reporting system (PMSI - Programme de Medicalisation des Systemes d'Information. The SNIIRAM is a centralized administrative database of all health services reimbursed under France's NHI program. The PMSI, based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), is a centralized administrative database of hospital discharge records by diagnosis, procedure, age and residence of patients from all hospitals in France. It is managed by a national agency (ATIH).

To calculate the proportion of rehospitalized patients (65þ) who received outpatient visits (all physician consultations in community-based practice, as well as hospital outpatient visits) between the time of discharge and rehospitalization, we collaborated with analysts at the French NHI fund (CNAMTS). We linked the individual identifying variable for rehospitalized patients and extracted the outpatient visits from the SNIIRAM database for all medical and surgical admissions. Of the total number of hospitalized French patients aged 18 years and over (5,804,677) with identifiers in 2010, only 299,364 (5%) were unidentified after linking these datasets.

Research suggests that Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) based approaches have the most evidence of effectiveness in the management of tinnitus.

Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that ICBT will result in reduced tinnitus-related distress, decreased sleep disturbance, decreased anxiety and depression, and improved health-related quality of life in a treatment group as compared with adults in the weekly check-in control-group in the U.S. population. The investigators also hypothesize that these results will be stable in both short- and long-term post-intervention.

Design: A two-armed Randomized Control Trial (RCT), with a one-year follow-up design will be used to evaluate the efficacy of ICBT on tinnitus distress.

Setting: This will be an Internet-based study for adults with tinnitus living in the State of Texas, USA.

Participants: Eligible participants will include adults with tinnitus for a minimum period of 3 months with internet access and no major medical or psychiatric conditions. 80 participants will be recruited for each group and will be randomly assigned using a computer-generated randomization schedule by an independent research assistant after being pre-stratified for language and tinnitus severity.

Intervention: The intervention offered is a guided CTB-based internet intervention (ICBT), providing an opportunity to learn about new ways of coping with tinnitus during everyday life. It is 8-week long e-learning intervention, with new modules introduced weekly and assignments are given to practice techniques learned.

Outcome measures: The main outcome measure is the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI).

This study treatment is different from standard treatment in that it extends the intensive glucose control beyond the third postoperative day to one full year. Once discharged from the hospital following the CABG procedure, the intense glucose control is done using subcutaneous insulin (a shot under the skin), oral medications, and by measuring blood sugar levels frequently.

For 14 years our research team has successfully implemented an increasingly aggressive series of intravenous insulin protocols that normalize blood glucose levels for 3 postoperative days in patients with diabetes who undergo cardiac surgery. This has resulted in significant reductions in mortality, infection and length of stay (LOS) and has normalized those outcomes to those of the population without diabetes (DM). The current protocol ends on the morning of the 3rd postoperative day.

We believe that a logical expansion of this groundbreaking work is to extend the duration of intensive glycemic control beyond the third postoperative day and into the outpatient period. However it would be impossible to do so with the continued use of CII therapy. Therefore, we propose to employ intensive subcutaneous insulin therapies and oral hypoglycemic agents to affect continued tight glycemic control following discontinuation of CII and continue such therapy beyond hospital discharge for a period of at least one year.

We hypothesize that this will lead to further reductions in major adverse cardiac outcomes in the high-risk diabetes coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) subgroup. The optimal method to test this hypothesis is with a very large, multi-center clinical trial. However, before embarking on such a resource-consuming endeavor, we intend to test the concepts, methods, implementation strategies, patient acceptability and compliance, proposed biomarkers and clinical outcomes of such a trial with this proposed limited pilot study.

If the information obtained from this pilot study is favorable, we will submit for full funding of the multicenter USCDP clinical trial to the NIDDK and NHLBI divisions of the NIH.

Each participant will also complete a questionnaire concerning a variety of possible risk factors such as physical activity, medical history, medication history, and other risk factors. The mothers of all participants will be invited to participate by completing a questionnaire concerning perinatal exposures and events and by donating a saliva sample.

The three main objectives of this study are to:

determine whether environmental endocrine modulators (i.e., chlorinated pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls) are related to risk of GCT and, if so, whether their effects are augmented by other risk factors.
determine whether genetic susceptibility to GCT exists and to characterize the environmental risk factors related to that susceptibility.

Epidemiological evidence for the association between excess meat intake and negative health outcomes (such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes) as well as negative environmental impacts (such as pollution, overuse of resources, and carbon emissions) indicates that reducing meat consumption should be particularly pertinent to researchers and other public health professionals.

The potential of using widespread communication campaigns, such as Meatless Monday, to reduce meat consumption by educating individuals on the associated health and environmental risks appears to be promising. However, the current literature is missing information regarding what types of messages are most effective (e.g. negative environmental messages vs. negative health messages). To address this knowledge gap, our study will collect quantitative data in measurable outcomes to understand effectiveness and comprehension of environmental messages and health messages to reduce meat consumption.

Setting: This is an online study using Qualtrics, so this research does not involve talking to human participants.

Recruitment: Participants will be recruited through Prime Panels, a survey research firm through which participants voluntarily sign up to participate in research studies.

Informed Consent: Participants will read a written consent document that includes information about the study's purpose, expectations, and possible risks and benefits. Participants will acknowledge that they have read and agreed to the terms by clicking forward.

Randomization: Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) control (about checking their credit score), 2) environment-focused Meatless Monday messages, or 3) health-focused Meatless Monday messages.

Assessment: Using an online platform (Qualtrics), participants will answer a screening question about red meat consumption. If they are eligible (consumption of red meat 1 time per week or more), they will proceed to the main study after reading and agreeing to the written consent form. Participants will then answer two questions about their belief in climate change. Participants will then view four messages in their ascribed conditions. After viewing all 4 messages, participants will answer a series of questions about the messages they viewed. Then, participants will answer a series of demographic questions. Participants will also answer questions about grocery shopping preferences.

To achieve this goal, we will implement an external facilitation intervention that has been shown to improve implementation in HIV service settings. The intervention will leverage a naloxone implementation expert who will work with SSP organizational directors to identify barriers to and facilitators of achieving naloxone implementation quality and maximizing reach. We propose to assess the effectiveness of external facilitation, compared to dissemination of an implementation manual, in a national sample of SSPs in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Our proposed specific aims are as follows:

Aim 1: To characterize United States syringe service programs along the exploration, preparation, implementation and sustainment (EPIS) continuum for delivering naloxone.

Aim 2: To test the effectiveness of external facilitation + dissemination of the naloxone implementation manual, compared with dissemination of the naloxone implementation manual alone, to improve the advancement of naloxone along the EPIS continuum among United States syringe service programs.

Hypothesis. The dissemination and external facilitation arm will be more effective in advancing naloxone implementation along the EPIS continuum between baseline and 12-month follow-up, than the dissemination-only arm.

To achieve these aims, 425 SSPs that are registered with the North American Syringe Exchange Network (NASEN) and /or receive information from harm reduction related web-based forums (e.g., online discussion groups, newsletters and listservs)will be asked to participate in an on-line cross-sectional survey and will be sent a hyperlink to the initial screening survey. We will use the on-line survey results to characterize the SSPs along the exploration, preparation, implementation and sustainment (EPIS) continuum for delivering the naloxone intervention (AIM 1).

The on-line survey includes a set of questions designed to collect information to evaluate where the SSP falls along the EPIS continuum for naloxone delivery. SSPs in the Implementation (I) phase of the EPIS continuum (estimated n = 100) will be contacted by research staff and offered the opportunity to participate in the RCT. SSPs that are interested in participating in the RCT will be enrolled in the study. For those SSPs who agree to participate, study staff will confirm eligibility by reviewing and documenting responses to the screening survey.

Following informed consent procedures, the study staff will administer the baseline survey to the SSP representative. The baseline survey will include questions about programmatic capacity, organizational culture, potential for internal champion or leader, perceived need for naloxone distribution within their community, and community acceptance of peer naloxone distribution programming. The study staff will then randomize SSPs into one of the one of the two study arms: (1) dissemination of the implementation manual and external facilitation for 12 months (experimental arm; n=50) and (2) dissemination of the implementation manual only (control arm; n=50).

All SSPs enrolled in the RCT will be sent a copy of the naloxone implementation manual either via email, hyperlink or the U.S. postal service depending on the preference of the participant. Those SSPs in the experimental arm will be enrolled in the EF intervention during which they will work directly with an OC to advance naloxone delivery as far along the EPIS continuum as possible during a 12-month period. The intervention will be delivered via phone calls, web-enabled audio and screen-sharing technology, and site visits. The key activities of the EF intervention include, initial SSP engagement, knowledge enhancement, capacity assessment, information gathering, identification of barriers and facilitators, development of action plans and provision of feedback, identification of funding and linkage to resources, and training of SSP staff.

At the end of the 12-month intervention period, SSPs in both study arms will participate in a follow-up survey, conducted by study staff, to evaluate advancement of naloxone implementation along the EPIS continuum.",0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

- Malaria is a severe infection caused by a parasite. People can get malaria if a mosquito that carries the parasite bites them. Malaria infection does not happen in the United States, but many people in Africa, Asia, and South America are at risk for it. Researchers want to test two vaccines that may help decrease malaria infection.

Objective:

- To see if two vaccines (Pfs25M-EPA/Alhydrogel and Pfs230DIM-EPA/Alhydrogel ) are safe in humans and cause an immune response that will prevent malaria parasites from correctly growing in the mosquito.

Eligibility:

- Healthy adults ages 18 50.

Design:

There are several groups in this study. Each group will receive a different dose of the vaccine and some groups will received both vaccines.
Vaccinations will be given on two days about 4 weeks apart.
Participants will receive each vaccine as an injection into the arm. Blood will be drawn on the day of vaccination.
In the 4 weeks after receiving a vaccination, participants will have at least 3 clinic visits and 1 phone contact. They will have at least 3 more visits and 3 phone contacts over the next 6 months.
At each visit, participants will be evaluated for side effects to the vaccine and any new health changes or problems. They will be asked how they are feeling and if they have taken any medicine. Blood and urine samples may be taken at the visit. More follow-up visits may be needed to follow up on changes or problems.","Study of the Safety and Immunogenicity of Pfs230D1M-EPA/Alhydrogel and Pfs25M-EPA/Alhydrogel , a Transmission Blocking Vaccine Against Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria, in Adults in the U.S. and Mali",0,0,0,0,0,UNKNOWN,"Rodolphe Merieux Laboratory@@@Bamako, Mali","October 22, 2018",Actual,Malaria,"['D000011528', 'D000010272']","['Protozoan Infections', 'Parasitic Diseases']","['BC03', 'All', 'BC01', 'Rare']","['Parasitic Diseases', 'All Conditions', 'Bacterial and Fungal Diseases', 'Rare Diseases']","['Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria', 'Malaria', 'Malaria']","['M17716', 'M9863', 'M8866', 'M4951', 'M12971', 'M11768', 'T3576']","['Malaria, Falciparum', 'Malaria', 'Infection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Protozoan Infections', 'Parasitic Diseases', 'Malaria']","['high', 'high', 'low', 'low', 'low', 'low', 'high']","['D000008288', 'D000016778']","['Malaria', 'Malaria, Falciparum']",0,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,0,Double,0,0,Prevention,0,"['Participant', 'Investigator']","A vaccine to interrupt malaria transmission would be a valuable tool for local elimination or

Current RA treatment emphasizes: 1) the need for early and aggressive treatment, and 2) the use of a treat-to-target approach. However, patients often struggle with treatment decisions, especially when the options have both benefits and risks. To address this challenge, investigators based at Arthritis Research Canada have previously developed an online decision aid called ANSWER-2 (ANimated, Self-serve, WEb-based, Research Tool: Version 2) for RA patients who are considering a biologic, and this tool has been recently adapted for the US healthcare setting (called US-ANSWER-2).

Objectives: 1) To evaluate the effectiveness of US-ANSWER-2 in reducing patients' decisional conflict. 2) To assess the extent to which US-ANSWER-2 improves patients' knowledge about RA medications and confidence in managing their health. 3) To examine the experiences of patients and rheumatologists in using US-ANSWER-2.

The investigators will conduct a proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial with 80 patients with RA. Eligible individuals are those: 1) with a diagnosis of RA from a rheumatologist, 2) whose rheumatologists have recommended initiating a biologic or switching to another biologic, and 3) who have internet access and email. The Intervention Group will receive simple instructions to access the US-ANSWER-2 decision aid and complete the program on their own within two days. At the end of the session, a one-page summary will be produced to help them discuss their questions, concerns, and preferred choices with their health care providers. The Control Group will receive a standard online medication guide, reflective of usual practice. Participants will complete the Decisional Conflict Scale (primary outcome) before and after the intervention (US-ANSWER-2 or standard online medication guide). The following secondary outcome measures will be collected at baseline, Month 1, and Month 2: 1) Medication Education Impact Questionnaire, and 2) Partners in Health Scale. In addition, the use of healthcare resources will be collected at baseline and Month 2, and the use of biologics will be collected at Month 6.

The investigators expect to be able to differentiate between revenues lost due to the COVID-19-driven business recession and revenues lost due to the manipulation of reimbursement processes by insurance companies.

Most of the losses are due to doctors being forced to curtail elective procedures and office visits as Americans were ordered to stay home during the height of the national health emergency.

As Physicians were able to return to work in the early Summer, even if only partially, many had to adjust to the newer medical practice of telehealth, and the lower revenues that came with it. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) gave assurances to Physicians that Medicare would reimburse telehealth encounters at 100% of the office visit rate. But private Payers were under no such obligation. Across the country, Physicians are reporting that they're being reimbursed at about 70% of an office visit rate despite the fact that telehealth requires both resources and expertise to implement effectively, and each encounter takes up to twice as long as an office visit.

Adding to financial hardships, Physicians across the nation are reporting that legitimate insurance claims are being held up and denied by the insurance companies at a higher rate than ever, cutting off the cash that they need so desperately. As of June 1, only half of Physician practices say they have enough cash to stay open for another month.

In just 2 months in the spring of 2020, over 45 million Americans lost their jobs and for many, that also meant the loss of their employment-related health insurance. Despite shedding a massive number of members from their rolls, health insurance companies are actually predicting record profits for 2020. The pandemic it seems, is very good indeed for the health insurance business. Private investors and executives are taking huge dividends and bonuses out of the system just at a time when US healthcare needs a vast new investment of healthcare resources into the system. The good fortune of a few individuals and corporations comes at an as yet untold expense to American society.

The formula for insurance company success in a pandemic only happens one way. By keeping member premiums, delaying payments, and denying treatment authorizations, the large health insurance companies are taking advantage of the profound misfortunes of both doctors and patients during a national health emergency.

The COVID-19 pandemic will have adverse effects on the health of Americans that will be sprawling and long-felt. However, it is not for this study to decide whether private interests will always be antithetical to public interests when it comes to healthcare. That is a public debate that will continue to evolve as the profound weaknesses of the American way of distributing healthcare are magnified and exposed in a time of social upheaval.

The investigators do know that in order to get a handle on the major damage we see occurring in real-time- and to inform that debate, it is first necessary to measure it.",0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

These deaths occurred among both non-pregnant and recently pregnant women. Clostridium has been isolated from the vagina in 4-18% of normal, health non-pregnant women, with Clostridium perfringens the most common isolate. Most studies do not differentiate the small percentage of other clostridia present in the vaginal microenvironment. The vaginal carriage rate for Clostridium sordellii remains unknown, but is probably very low, less than 1%.

The correlates of clostridial carriage are unknown, and data on the etiology and lethality of clostridial infection among women of reproductive age are insufficient to guide possible courses of safe and effective prevention.

Determine the effect of participant and provider knowledge of a positive APOL1 status on the probability of appropriate CKD diagnosis.
Determine the effect of participant and provider knowledge of a positive APOL1 status on the probability of receiving a urine microalbumin/creatinine testing and ACE-I/ARB prescription based on results of the urine microalbumin level.
Explore cost effectiveness, mediators, moderators, psychobehavioral impact of results disclosure on participants, and effects of participant and provider knowledge of APOL1 status on provider treatment recommendations.

PGX Substudy

In addition, GUARDD-US will include a substudy to determine the effect of knowledge of genetic test results that predict efficacy of various antihypertensive medications on change in SBP from baseline to 3 months in APOL1 negative individuals.

Approximately 5,435 participants of African ancestry age 18-70 with hypertension that either: 1) do not have diabetes and do not have CKD, or 2) have CKD. Participants with diabetes may be included as long as they also have CKD.

Population for Main Study:

Participants from Randomized Population (above) who test positive for APOL1

Population for PGx Substudy:

Participants from Randomized Population (above) randomized to Intervention and who test negative for APOL1

Main Study Analyses:

To determine the effect of participant and provider knowledge of a positive APOL1 status on SBP, we will compare the change in SBP from baseline to 3 months of the Intervention - APOL1 positive group to the change in SBP from baseline to 3 months of the Control - APOL1 positive group using a two sided Mann Whitney test, as appropriate, with a two-sided type I error of 0.05.
The effect of knowledge of a positive APOL1 status on all secondary endpoints will be compared between Intervention - APOL1 positives to Control - APOL1 positives with the proportion difference test.
Additional analyses will include analysis of time trends in SBP, subset analyses, and exploratory analyses of cost effectiveness, mediators, moderators, psychobehavioral impact of results disclosure on participants, and effects of knowledge of APOL1 status on provider treatment recommendations.

Substudy Analyses:

All primary and secondary endpoint analyses conducted for the APOL1 main study will be repeated for the PGx substudy focusing on differences in outcomes between APOL1 negative individuals with immediate PGx ROR (PGx Intervention) and APOL1 negative individuals with delayed PGx ROR (PGx Control).",Genetic Testing to Understand and Address Renal Disease Disparities Across the United States,teji.rb@duke.edu,Teji Rakhra-Burris,919-684-9849,0,Contact,0,0,"July 15, 2022",Anticipated,Renal Disease,D000014570,Urologic Diseases,"['BXS', 'All']","['Urinary Tract, Sexual Organs, and Pregnancy Conditions', 'All Conditions']",Renal Disease,"['M9281', 'M15902']","['Kidney Diseases', 'Urologic Diseases']","['high', 'low']",D000007674,Kidney Diseases,0,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Immediate versus delayed return of Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene testing results to provider and participant.,None (Open Label),0,0,Treatment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

Despite its prevalence, Lean Diabetes remains a relatively unknown disease that stirs conflicting opinions regarding its classification, diagnostic criteria, and pathogenesis.

In this study, the investigators will study individuals meeting the criteria for Lean Diabetes, Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and patients without diabetes using a procedure called a ""pancreatic clamp"" study. During the clamp procedure, glucose (a sugar) and insulin (a hormone produced in the pancreas that regulates the amount of glucose in the blood) are infused with an intravenous catheter, and blood samples are collected periodically throughout the procedure to measure blood sugar levels and the levels of several hormones that are found in the body and are related to glucose metabolism. Endogenous glucose production (a measure of the body's production of sugar) will also be measured. Participants will also have a fat biopsy, and will be given a mixed meal challenge which is a test that detects hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance.

A clinical examination along with photographs will be performed prior to application of the photosensitizer to determine the baseline number of actinic keratoses. The treatment steps were adapted from the daylight-PDT protocol presented in the phase III European multicenter study.9 The treatment will be performed if the temperature conditions are suitable to stay outdoors for 2.5 hours and not under any rainy weather conditions; however, treatment can be performed on overcast days. Suitable weather conditions include an outdoor temperature greater than 50 and between the months of April and November. This is based on a minimum of 8 J cm-2 (although other studies have shown that only 3.5 J cm-2) protoporphyrin IX light dose. A study of various geographic regions found this minimum dose was present in Turin, Italy, which is a similar latitude to Boston, MA.10 Weather conditions will be recorded on the day of treatment and final analysis will be stratified by temperature and weather conditions to evaluate whether this has impacted treatment. Subjects will be advised of the treatment requirements at the time of appointment booking and will be instructed to call the morning of their appointment to confirm that treatment can proceed. Subjects will scrub their faces with warm soapy water to clean and descale the skin and any hypertrophic AKs will be curetted. A chemical sunscreen will be applied to all sun exposed areas followed by one applicator of ALA (Levulan, DUSA pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, MA) to each treatment area. Subjects will be instructed to be exposed to daylight within 30-60 minutes of application and will remain outside in the shade for two and a half hours. Subjects will then remove the ALA and will be instructed to minimize sun exposure and to apply a physical sunscreen (zinc oxide or titanium dioxide) and wear protective clothing for the next 48 hours.

Given the lack of prior research in this area in the Air Force and the broad number of topics of interest, the aims of the study are predominantly exploratory and results may be hypothesis generating.

The MilSeq Project will be conducted in two sequential phases. Phase I of the study will recruit, consent, and enroll approximately 750 ostensibly healthy active-duty Airmen who receive medical care in military Primary Care, Internal Medicine, and/or Family Practice settings to take a baseline survey. This survey will be administered to explore active-duty Airmen's perceptions of and preferences for GS, identify motivations and barriers to active-duty Airmen participating in a WES study, and assess interest in taking part in the WES study.

Phase II of the study will recruit, consent, and enroll 75 ostensibly healthy active-duty Airmen who receive medical care in military Primary Care, Internal Medicine and/or Family Practice settings who in their baseline survey expressed interest in receiving WES through a research study. WES will be performed on each enrolled patient-participant. The result will be disclosed by an HCP-participant and permanently integrated into the patient-participant's EMR. Phase II will also recruit 10-20 military Primary Care, Internal Medicine, and/or Family Practice HCPs and consent them to participate in the study. The HCPs will receive an educational primer in genomics and will disclose WES results to Airmen participants.

There are a number of potential benefits and challenges to incorporating genomic medicine into the military, some that are relevant to the broader civilian community, but some that are unique to this population. Some of these challenges include: (a) how GS may or may not affect the perception of fitness for duty; (b) how genomic discrimination may or may not occur in the military setting; (c) how to best deal with unanticipated findings; and (d) how genomic results can be practically integrated into a military setting. In this pilot study, these potential opportunities and challenges will be explored, which will provide a basis for future study and begin to inform decisions regarding clinical care of active-duty service members.",0,0,0,0,"Patient-Participant Inclusion Criteria:

This study will provide a contemporary description of the epidemiology and medical management of United States adults with severe asthma who have not achieved control with high-dose ICS therapy and additional controllers. Additionally, the study will describe the use of and outcomes associated with recently approved monoclonal antibody therapies for severe asthma. Patients will be enrolled from a diverse population of academic and community-based specialist centers across the US. Data will be collected in a naturalistic manner and patient management will not be influenced by the study protocol. At least 1500 patients in the US with a confirmed diagnosis of severe asthma will be enrolled by a diverse set of asthma specialists (eg, allergists and pulmonologists who treat asthma) from academic and community-based centers. Basic de-identified information will be collected for all patients meeting study inclusion criteria, including those not approached for enrollment or who decline enrollment, to enable an assessment of the enrolled and non-enrolled populations. This information will include age, sex, insurance status, age at asthma diagnosis, class of asthma treatment per study inclusion criteria, number of asthma exacerbations in the past 12 months, study eligibility, whether the patient was approached for enrollment, study enrollment status, and reason for not enrolling for those who are approached but do not enroll. Patient-reported asthma control (Asthma Control Test [ACT]), asthma exacerbations, and treatment adherence will be solicited monthly. Patient-reported information on asthma-related healthcare utilization, global evaluation of treatment effectiveness (GETE), and work productivity (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Asthma questionnaire [WPAI-Asthma]) will be collected at baseline and approximately every 3 months. Detailed information on asthma-related quality of life (Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]) as well as presence of an asthma treatment plan will be collected from patients approximately every 6 months.

1. Individuals with a diagnosis of severe asthma for at least 12 months prior to enrollment and confirmed by the Investigator not to be due to alternative diagnoses.

2. Currently receiving care from specialist physicians (eg, pulmonologists and or allergists) at the Investigator's or sub-investigator's site.

3. 18 years of age and older. 4. Meeting at least one of the following three criteria (a, b, or c):

a. Uncontrolled on asthma treatment consistent with GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) Step 4 or 5, receiving high-dose ICS with additional controllers.

i. Uncontrolled is defined by meeting at least one of the following (as outlined by ATS/ERS [American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society] guidelines):

Poor symptom control: Asthma Control Questionnaire consistently ≥1.5, ACT <20 (or ""not well controlled"" by NAEPP [National Asthma Education and Prevention Program]/GINA guidelines).
Frequent severe exacerbations: two or more bursts of systemic corticosteroids (≥3 days each) in the previous 12 months.
Serious exacerbations: at least one hospitalization, intensive care unit stay or mechanical ventilation in the previous 12 months.
Airflow limitation: after appropriate bronchodilator withhold FEV1 <80% predicted (in the face of reduced FEV1/FVC defined as less than the lower limit of normal).

ii. For the purposes of this study, high-dose ICS will be defined as

1. ICS at a cumulative dose of >500 μg fluticasone propionate equivalents daily as defined in Appendix A, or 2. Highest labeled dose of a combination of ICS/LABA. b. Current use of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibody agent for treatment of severe asthma (use is not primarily for an alternative condition).

c. Use of systemic corticosteroids or other systemic immunosuppressants (any dose level) for approximately 50% or more of the prior 12 months for treatment of severe asthma (use is not primarily for an alternative condition).

Exclusion Criteria

Not willing and able to sign written informed consent. Consent can be obtained from having a responsible, legally authorized representative acting on patient's behalf.
Not fluent in English or Spanish.
Inability to complete study follow-up or web-based PROs. If the patient does not have email or web access, minimal assistance from others to access the web-based PRO is permitted (ie receiving the email and/or assisting patient in navigating to the web page); PROs must be completed by the patient.

Received an investigational therapy for asthma, allergy, atopic disease, or eosinophilic disease as part of a clinical trial during the 6 months prior to enrollment.

Once enrolled in the CHRONICLE Study, patients can enroll in trials of investigational therapies (as well as other non-interventional studies) as long as they continue to complete study follow-up. If a patient enrolls in a trial of an investigational therapy, the identity (National Clinical Trial [NCT] number) of the study and dates of the first and last investigational therapy administrations will be collected. If a patient receives blinded therapy in a trial, the Investigator will request the identity of that therapy at trial conclusion so that treatment information collected for the current study may be

Recently, the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) system was advocated for treating intertrochanteric fractures (ITFs) in the elderly patients. However, the true effect of the closed suction drainage system with PFNA fixation on outcomes in ITFs is still unknown. This prospective randomized controlled trial aimed to examine whether routine drainage is useful for PFNA fixation in ITFs.

Methods: A total of 80 patients with acute ITFs were treated with closed or mini-open reduction with PFNA fixation at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital and 60 eligible patients (22 men and 38 women) were randomized for whether to receive suction drainage. In clinical outcomes, the visual analog scale (VAS), morphine equivalent dosage, injured thigh width, body temperature, and wound condition with specific reference to hematoma formation and wound infection were measured on postoperative days 1, 2, 4, and 10.

The investigators established a table of random numbers, which was readily generated by computer 15, and divided participants into the drained and undrained groups based on their arrival time to the investigator's hospital.

Surgery procedure

Experienced trauma surgeons performed all the procedures. General or spinal anesthesia was determined by anesthesiologist. All patients received a single dose of 1 g cefazolin as preoperative prophylactic antibiotic. All the operations were performed on a traction table in supine position under fluoroscopic guidance. Reduction was achieved with closed reduction or mini-open reduction, including percutaneous Kapandji procedure or a minimally invasive procedure using the cerclage wire passer (Cerclage passer, DePuy Synthes, Solothurn, Switzerland). The reduction was regarded acceptable if no significant varus malalignment of the proximal fragment (neck-shaft angle more than 15°) existed or if less than 10 mm of translation existed between the main fragments as described previously. After achieving reduction, the skin was incised 3-5 cm proximal to the tip of the greater trochanter followed by straight longitudinal incision in the fascia of the gluteus muscle. The gluteus maximus muscle was split using the blunt dissection technique to gain access to the tip of the trochanter, which was followed by the insertion of the intramedullary guide wire. A protection drill sleeve was used to the trochanter and progressive reaming was performed until the diameter was 1 mm greater than that of the selected nail. After proximal reaming up to 16 mm, nail was manually inserted up to an adequate depth under fluoroscopic guidance, which was followed by positioning of blade guide wire. The blade was positioned in the center or distal third of the femoral neck on the anteroposterior view and in the middle third of the femoral neck on the lateral view. The blade was inserted and locked with the closure of fracture gap that was followed by application of a distal screw with gig and protection sleeve. End caps were not applied in all the cases because nearly none of the implants were to be removed. In the drained group, a hemovac drain (Zimmer Biomet, Autotransfusion System [HAS], United State) was placed beneath the fascia of the gluteus muscle, surrounding the entry point of the nail at the fracture site. The fascia of the gluteus muscle was repaired with absorbable sutures, Vicryl 1-0. The duration of operation was defined as the interval between the initiation of reduction and the wound closure.

Postoperative care All the patients received a prophylactic antibiotic therapy of 1 g cefazolin every 8 hours for 1 day after surgery. All wounds were covered with a surgical dressing only and wound care was practiced on postoperative days 1, 2, and 4. The drain was removed within 24 hours based on the drainage condition, except when more than 250 ml fluid was drained in 24 hours 2, 12. Hb and Hct were examined on postoperative days 1, 2, and 4. The criterion for postoperative BT was a hemoglobin level of less than 8 mg/dL or presence of symptoms indicative of hypoxia. To control postoperative pain due to the influence of different anesthetic methods, the investigators measured visual analog score (VAS) at rest from postoperative day 1. The basic regimen after surgery was a combination of oral analgesics, acetaminophen and etoricoxib. After receiving the combination therapy, if the VAS score was more than 5, the investigators administered a subcutaneous morphine injection for pain control.

Postoperative rehabilitation All the patients were encouraged to mobilize as early as possible to prevent complications associated with immobilization. Passive rehabilitation, including passive range of motion of the affected lower limb and practice for sitting at the edge of the bed, was initiated on postoperative day 1. Partial weight bearing ambulation and rehabilitation with walker was commenced on postoperative day 2. The extent of weight bearing was adjusted by the surgeon based on the stability of the fracture and the physical strength of the patient. Morphine was administered to patients when required during the rehabilitation period.

Data collection One independent observer who was not involved with the treatment performed the clinical assessments and laboratory data collection during the preoperative and intraoperative periods and on postoperative days 1, 2, and 4 (during admission) and on postoperative day 10 for suture removal.

Primary outcome The investigators defined TBL and BT as primary outcome variables that were calculated in millimeter. TBL was measured using the Mercuriali's formula because of its accuracy, which was based on previous studies. Mercuriali's formula: TBL = blood volume (BV) × (Hct [preop] - Hct [POD 4] + transfused RBC [mL])

Secondary outcome The clinical outcomes included body temperature, VAS (for pain assessment), opioid dosage (morphine equivalent), width of the injured proximal thigh (20 cm distal to the ipsilateral anterior superior iliac spine [ASIS]), wound condition, and the other laboratory data. The wound condition was assessed based on criteria described previously with specific reference to hematoma formation and wound infection. The severity of hematoma surrounding the wound site was classified into 3 grades as follows: none, moderate (ecchymosis without swelling), and severe (ecchymosis with swelling of the wound, resulting in tension on the skin sutures) [Fig. 2]. Wound infection was classified in 2 groups: superficial infection and deep infection. A wound infection was defined as superficial when 3 of the following symptoms occurred: fever, wound discharge, and wound redness, which usually could be controlled with antibiotic prescription. A deep wound infection involved the tissue beneath the fascia of the gluteus muscle and the implant, which usually required debridement or revision. The investigators recorded hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels on postoperative days 1, 2, and 4 as secondary laboratory outcomes.

Statistical analysis The primary objective of the study was to determine whether routine drainage in PFNA fixation for ITFs is useful. Descriptive statistics, including estimated mean and standard deviation, for continuous variables and percentages and frequencies for categorical variables were tabulated and presented. Because the sample size of both the groups was small, a nonparametric method, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for comparing continuous variables and the Fisher's exact test was used to analyze the categorical variables. Box and whisker plots were used to demonstrate the BT and TBL distribution between the drained and undrained groups for intertrochanteric fracture treated with PFNA. All statistical tests were 2-sided and a p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analysis was performed with R version 3.6.1 for Windows. The investigators calculated the required sample size that would provide 90% power (α = 0.05) to the trial for detecting the difference in TBL and BT based on previous studies 12, 21. Hence, the investigators enrolled 30 patients in each group.",0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

the first cohort will consist of approximately 500 subjects on PCSK9i at the time of enrollment. The goal is to include a large enough cohort of patients receiving PCSK9i in real world clinical practice; this will allow (for the first time) to better understand the characteristics of those patients whose treatment is escalated to include PCSK9i, the therapeutic effects of PCSK9i outside of the randomized clinical trial settings, and over a prolonged duration of follow up;
the second cohort will enroll approximately 2000 subjects with LDL-C levels greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL. The purpose is to include a large group of patients with established ASCVD and suboptimal LDL control in order to better understand the treatment patterns and rates of CV events in this group;
the third group will enroll approximately 2500 subjects with LDL-C levels between 70 and 99 mg/dL. The purpose is to include a large group of patients with established ASCVD and more optimal control of LDL.
To better understand patient characteristics, lipid-lowering treatment management, rates of CV events, and potential opportunities for further LLT optimization in this group. Interactive voice response system will be used to track the number of subjects in each cohort. Once a cohort is filled, no more subjects may be enrolled into it. After the first subject is enrolled and annually thereafter, physicians will fill out a questionnaire on their general use of LLT type and dose and their overall goals of lipid management. The study specific data collection points are aligned with the standard of care physician scheduled visits. Each subject will be followed through a systematic series of medical chart reviews conducted at participating clinical sites. Initial chart reviews will occur at subject enrollment with subsequent scanning of charts occurring at the site every 6 months thereafter. In addition, questionnaires will be administered to subjects every 6 months via a CATI system (wherein an interviewer will ask the subject a series of standard questions) to determine general perceptions and attitudes towards LLT. The order of questions in the questionnaire will be based on subject response. This will facilitate reports of the number of inpatient visits, outpatient visits, outpatient procedures, diagnostic tests, prescription and nonprescription medication use in the prior 6 months. Subjects will be asked to complete questionnaires even if they do not routinely see the enrolling physician or if they have switched providers.",0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

In addition, of the more than one million Americans living with HIV, approximately one-fifth do not know they are infected. Identifying these individuals is among the biggest challenges for HIV prevention in the United States. Early diagnosis of such individuals, combined with prevention counseling and provision of health care, could decrease the spread of HIV and improve the survival of HIV-infected persons.

The recent introduction of rapid HIV testing offers a critical public health screening approach for facilitating earlier diagnoses of HIV infection. Rapid tests permit a sensitive and specific, fast, simple, minimally invasive, and cost-effective method to screen for HIV.

Project Aware expands on the CDC's Project RESPECT-2 study that was an expansion of the RESPECT study (a randomized controlled trial conducted in STD clinics in the mid-1990s before the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy and before the advent of rapid testing). Project RESPECT demonstrated that a 2-session, client centered counseling session based on behavioral theory with HIV testing was superior to a program with HIV testing and information only. This project showed that the counseling arm had significant reduction of STIs compared to those in the information arm. However, RESPECT did not include men who have sex with men (who account for 53% of all new HIV infections in the U.S.) and did not examine the cost effectiveness of the intervention. RESPECT-2 did include MSM, but it only compared a 1-session counseling session with rapid testing to 2-session counseling with traditional testing and did not address the question of whether counseling and testing is more effective than testing alone.

Project Aware combines the RESPECT-2 counseling approach by adapting the HIV Rapid Testing and Counseling in Drug Abuse Treatment Study (CTN 0032), a NIDA-sponsored randomized controlled clinical trial being conducted in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network (CTN) to sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics to provide important and timely data on the effect of counseling in high-risk populations tested in health care settings. In this adaptation of CTN 0032, we will assess the relative effectiveness of (1) on-site HIV rapid testing with brief, participant-tailored prevention counseling vs. (2) on-site HIV rapid testing with information only (as recommended in the CDC guidelines). Secondary outcomes are reduction of sexual risk behaviors, substance use during sex (i.e., being under the influence during sex) and cost and cost effectiveness of counseling and testing. Participants (approximately 5,000 from 9 STD clinics) will be assessed for STIs, HIV testing history and sexual and drug use risk behaviors at baseline and at 6-months follow-up. The battery of STI tests will screen for Neisseria gonorrhea (GC), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Trichomonas vaginalis, Herpes Simplex 2 (HSV-2) and Treponema pallidum (syphilis). HIV test results that yield a reactive result will receive a confirmatory HIV blood test that day, with results delivered 5-10 days later. All participants will be randomized into one of two arms: Group 1- HIV testing and brief, client-centered counseling or Group 2- HIV testing and information only. Group 1 will receive a rapid HIV test with brief prevention counseling that addresses risk reduction based on an evidence-based counseling approach (RESPECT-2 counseling), while Group 2 will receive a rapid HIV test with information only.

The primary outcome will be analyzed using logistic regression for the binary outcome, new diagnoses of STIs (Yes/No). The logistic regression analysis will predict 6-month STI incidence as a function of randomization group controlling for the baseline incidence of STI. ANCOVA will be used for the secondary continuous outcomes, number of sexual risk behaviors and number of sexual episodes involving substance use. Costs will be compared based on study records supplemented by site-level data collection. Primary analyses will be performed under intent-to-treat (ITT) criteria.",0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

preventable health behavior change that a person can make to lower cancer risk. In addition, telephone quitlines are an effective, science-based smoking cessation treatment that is universally accessible to smokers in the U.S. However, little research has explored promising approaches that could increase quitline use, improve quit rates, and inform resource allocation for quitline services. The proposed study will test three promising enhancements to the standard quitline treatment that typically consists of counseling and, possibly 2 weeks of a NRT medication. These enhancements are: 1) combination nicotine replacement therapy as recommended by the United States Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guideline on Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence; 2) extended duration of cessation medication use; and 3) an innovative counseling addition - cognitive medication adherence counseling - to optimize adherence to cessation medication. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of each intervention will be calculated. The findings of the proposed research have broad potential application and relevance to state quitlines, quitline service providers, and other purchasers of quitline services such as employers and insurers. Additionally, the study findings can potentially inform other telephone health behavior counseling programs.",Improving the Population-Wide Effectiveness of U.S. Tobacco Cessation Quitlines,0,0,0,0,0,"['OTHER_GOV', 'INDUSTRY', 'FED', 'NIH']","['Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services', 'Alere Wellbeing', 'Department of Health and Human Services', 'National Cancer Institute (NCI)']",November 2011,Actual,"['Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Randomized,Factorial Assignment,0,Single,0,0,Treatment,0,Outcomes Assessor,"The study design is a fully crossed 2x2x2 factorial design that tested the effect of two versus six weeks of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), the effect of NRT monotherapy (nicotine patch alone) versus NRT combination therapy (nicotine patch + oral NRT), and the effect of cognitive medication adherence counseling (CMAC) versus no CMAC.

Study Abstract: Prostate cancer is diagnosed in approximately 334,500 men each year and accounts for nearly 41,800 deaths in the United States. Prostate cancer is the leading cancer affecting veterans and the second leading cancer among all Americans. The causes of prostate cancer and, particularly, the reasons for the unusually high incidence rates in African-Americans remain obscure. Dietary factors likely play a role in fatal cases, while hormones are also important in regulating prostate cancer growth. Dr. Charles Huggins recognized this effect in the 1940's, with androgen deprivation remaining as the cornerstone of therapy for advanced disease. Despite the strong circumstantial evidence, neither epidemiologic studies nor basic sciences have produced clear insight into the etiologic role of hormones. However, recent observations regarding androgen receptor gene polymorphisms and their relation to endocrine expression and prostate cancer risk may be providing important clues as to how an etiologic role might be mediated at the molecular level. Thus, it is important to attempt to identify genetic markers of high-risk cancer patients for necessary screening and counseling efforts.

It has been recently demonstrated that the androgen receptor functions as a ligand-dependent transcriptional regulator, and that this regulation is important in controlling prostate growth and apoptosis. Heightened androgenic stimulation, a potential by-product of shortened CAG repeat length, could potentially increase the risk of prostate cancer development and progression. In particular, a shorter CAG repeat sequence may be associated with cancers that have features of higher histologic grade, extraprostatic extension, and distant metastases (stage C or D). Recent evidence indicates that men with shorter CAG repeats are at particularly higher risk for distant metastatic and fatal prostate cancer. The results demonstrated that a shorter CAG repeat sequence in the androgen receptor gene predicted higher grade and advanced state of prostate cancer at diagnosis, metastatic disease, and mortality. However, these studies have been limited to whites since only a small number of African American men with prostate cancer were included.

Prostate cancer incidence varies between African-American and white men. African-American men have the highest known incidence rates in the world, 66% higher than white men in the U.S. The genetic findings described above raise the possibility that racial differences in the distribution of androgen receptor polymorphisms may account for the higher rate of prostate cancer, the more advanced disease, and the younger age at presentation in African-Americans.

This study created a cohort of prostate cancer patients who are well characterized with respect to histology, stage of diagnosis, and (over time) mortality. This study is generating data regarding the length of the CAG repeat sequence occurring in the androgen receptor gene and major prostate cancer prognostic determinants (histologic grade and state) at the time of diagnosis in black and white veterans. CAG repeat lengths on the androgen receptor gene were evaluated for a cohort of 145 African American and 150 white veterans with prostate cancer.

Results: Mean androgen receptor gene CAG repeat lengths for Caucasians was 21.9 versus 19.8 for African Americans, p=0.0001. However, a truncated CAG repeat length (CAG <= 18 versus CAG > 18) was not associated with advanced stage of cancer at diagnosis, higher PSA at diagnosis, or higher Gleason score (each with p>0.5).

Conclusion: The mean androgen receptor CAG repeat length was 2 repeats shorter for African American versus white prostate cancer patients. These findings raise concern that prostate cancers in African American men may be less sensitive to hormonal therapy than those in white men. These findings provide biologic rationale for clinical trials that evaluate the joint administration of chemotherapy and hormone therapy for African American men with advanced prostate cancer.",0,0,0,0,Veterans who undergo prostate biopsy where biopsy results are positive or PSA less than 10Ng/ml.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Male,0,0,No,No,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Prostate cancer', 'CAG repeat sequence']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"January 21, 2009",Estimate,"January 20, 2009",FED,US Department of Veterans Affairs,Chicago,0,0,0,0,0,United States,"Vamc - Chicago-Lakeside, Il",Illinois,0,60611,0,18 Years,0,Study of Prostate Cancer in Black and White U.S. Veterans,FED,VA Office of Research and Development,709D,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Completed,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"['Adult', 'Older Adult']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,April 1998,0,February 2003,"January 1, 2001",Estimate,"December 29, 2000","December 30, 2000",0,Observational,0,0,0,0,"October 30, 2020",0

Hence, the MBAT program consists of delivery of the MBAT course, including homework mindfulness practice, and followed by an interval of homework mindfulness practice without course meetings.

The design relies on group randomization at the level of individual military cohort units. This is due to the military requirement that organic unit structure can be maintained during testing and course session scheduling.",None (Open Label),0,0,Basic Science,0,0,"Background: An individual's success in the U.S. Army relies on many factors including the integrity of executive functions (EFs). EFs comprise a complex, multi-faceted brain system necessary to pay attention, overcome habitual and automatic behaviors, regulate mood, and ensure that current behavior is in line with short and long-term goals.Yet, protracted periods of high uncertainty, high demands, and high stress can lead to decreases in the efficiency and availability of EFs. Given the high demands and psychological vulnerabilities that U.S. Army personnel may face, it is critical to provide them with training programs to protect against degradation of EFs (particularly attention and working memory) over high-stress, high-demand intervals. Prior research on mindfulness training (MT) in civilians and military servicemembers showed that MT can effectively protect against degradation in attention and working memory and benefit psychological well-being over high-demand intervals.

Problem: While being successful, prior MT programs required a considerable amount of time dedicated to training (e.g., 24-hour training) and it is challenging to integrate these long programs into the busy schedule of the U.S. Army personnel. To accommodate the time constraints, the principal investigator together with a mindfulness expert developed a short-form mindfulness training program contextualized for the U.S. Army; the program consists of 8-hour training and is known as MBAT, Mindfulness-Based Attention Training.

Project Goal: The present study aims to investigate the best practices for delivery of a short-form mindfulness training to U.S. Army Cohorts. Specifically, the present study will examine the best delivery structure for the MBAT by comparing MBAT course delivered in 2 weeks vs. 4 weeks.",0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

The future holds promise of the development of therapies that will promote degrees of repair and recovery of function for people living with SCI. Lessons learned from past ""failed"" SCI clinical trials, however, demonstrate that, in order to accurately evaluate the overall effectiveness of SCI therapies, more sensitive outcomes measures are needed. Specifically, and reflecting the ultimate goal of clinical interventions - inducing functional recovery - the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM), has been recommended for further testing and development for use as a measure of functional ability in future SCI clinical studies. The SCIM is a very simple questionnaire and score sheet that an evaluator uses to determine how independently a person with SCI can perform certain tasks.

A panel of SCI researchers recommended the SCIM as the most suitable among four candidate measures of functional recovery reviewed at a special meeting sponsored by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) at a joint meeting of the American Spinal Injury Association and the International Spinal Cord Society (ASIA-ISCoS) in Boston, MA, in June 2006. It was recommended that a large-scale, multi-center, prospective trial be conducted in the United States, which would mirror a recently published multi-site international study.

The proposed research on the SCIM III, the latest and most sensitive version of the SCIM, would test the hypothesis that the SCIM III is a valid, reliable, and sensitive measure of functional ability in persons with SCI. Twenty-two rehabilitation centers throughout the United States will enroll a maximum of 660 subjects. Functional ability will be measured with the SCIM III during the first week of admittance into inpatient acute rehabilitation and within one week of discharge from the same rehabilitation program. Statistical analyses will be used to test the validity, reliability, and sensitivity of the SCIM III. The results will demonstrate whether the SCIM III is a suitable outcome measure to assess SCI specific functional ability in future clinical trials.",Study to Assess the Validity and Reliability of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM III),0,0,0,0,0,"['OTHER', 'OTHER', 'OTHER', 'OTHER', 'FED', 'FED', 'OTHER', 'OTHER', 'OTHER', 'OTHER', 'OTHER', 'OTHER', 'OTHER', 'OTHER', 'UNKNOWN', 'UNKNOWN', 'OTHER', 'OTHER', 'OTHER', 'OTHER', 'OTHER']","['University of Pittsburgh', 'University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center', 'Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center', 'University of Missouri-Columbia', 'James A.

Participating facilities will be offered vaccine education for residents and staff, but will be randomly allocated to receive aTIV (FLUAD) vaccine or usual care (TIV) vaccination for their residents.

BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRI), including pneumonia, bronchitis, and tracheobronchitis, is the leading cause of infectious mortality and hospitalization in older adults , and nursing home (NH) residents. Pneumonia and infection often produce attenuated signs and symptoms in older adults, leading to delayed or even misdiagnosis for this population. Diagnosis is further compromised due to few and sporadic clinician visits with nursing home residents, and reduced access to radiology. LRI may or may not directly lead to hospitalization, but LRIs are associated with considerable other morbidity than can result in hospitalization, including exacerbation of underlying cardiopulmonary diseases. Hospitalization rates for NH residents vary considerably between facilities, but the majority of hospitalizations occur during the 12 weeks during which influenza peaks each year.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to estimate the differences in hospitalization rates during influenza season experienced by long-stay nursing home residents, between facilities using adjuvanted trivalent vaccine vs. standard trivalent vaccine. The secondary objective is to estimate the differences in the likelihood of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) functional decline and mortality rates in the study nursing homes, and influenza outbreaks.",0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

Early detection of colon cancer and removal of precancerous adenomatous polyps have been shown to reduce its morbidity, mortality and incidence. There are several recommended CRC screening tests, including fecal occult blood test (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, air-contrast barium enema, and colonoscopy. In the VA, FOBT is the predominant screening test for CRC. Numerous randomized controlled trials have established the efficacy of FOBT in CRC screening. Its advantages include privacy, noninvasiveness, and cost-effectiveness. Use of guaiac-based testing, however, is hampered by low patient compliance, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. The poor patient compliance, and low specificity and positive predictive value, may be related to the testing procedure. For example, dietary and medication restrictions are recommended to decrease false-negative and false-positive tests. Such restrictions may impede patient compliance. Recently, several studies have evaluated the effectiveness immunochemical-based testing as a potential alternative, with reportedly better compliance, sensitivity, and specificity than guaiac-based tests. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the diagnostic validity of a new IFOBT (Teco Diagnostics) in U.S. veterans and to compare it with the guaiac based FOBT.",0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

Association between nativity and diet quality was done using multivariable-adjusted linear regression for the continuous total diet quality scores and their components, or multinomial (polytomous) logistic regression for categorical tertiles (low, medium, or high) of the total scores and their components. The study found that foreign-born Blacks had significantly higher AHEI-2010 and DASH scores compared to U.S-born Blacks, and more favorable intakes for many of the score components. Among foreign-born Blacks, diet quality did not significantly differ by length of residency. Foreign-born Blacks were more likely to be in the high than low tertile for fruit (including and excluding fruit juice), vegetables (excluding starchy vegetables), percent whole grains, and omega-3 fatty acids. Overall, the study suggests that foreign-born Blacks have better diet quality compared to their U.S.-born counterparts. Considering nativity among U.S. Blacks in nutrition research and public health efforts may therefore improve accuracy of characterizing dietary intakes and facilitate development of targeted nutrition interventions to reduce diet-related diseases in the diverse Black population in the U.S.",0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

The incidence of serogroup B meningococcal disease however is too low to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to determine the actual efficacy of the new serogroup B vaccines. Instead vaccine efficacy was inferred from serum bactericidal antibody responses using four test strains. However, because of strain variability of FHbp amino acid sequence (there are more than 800 sequence variants described) and strain variability of FHbp expression, bactericidal data on only four strains are unlikely to be sufficient to predict the actual strain coverage by the vaccine. There also are gaps in knowledge about the underlying mechanisms by which human antibodies to FHbp elicit complement mediated bactericidal activity. For example, binding of FH to FHbp is specific for human FH. Therefore in vaccinated humans the vaccine antigen is expected to form a complex with FH right after immunization. The investigators' hypothesis is that binding of human FH to the vaccine antigen skews the antibody repertoire to FHbp epitopes located outside of the FH combining site. The resulting antibodies would be expected not to inhibit binding of FH to the bacteria. This hypothesis will be investigated in Trumenba-immunized humans as part of studies in Aim 1 (and in future studies of recombinant human anti-FHbp Fabs that will be enabled by obtaining DNA from individual B cells, described in Aim 2).",0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

The primary aim of this study is:

To determine whether an early detection intervention can reduce DUP in the US, as compared to usual detection. Early detection (ED) will be implemented in one US community (New Haven, CT), and usual detection efforts will continue in another (Boston, MA). DUP will be measured at admission to the corresponding first-episode services (STEP & PREP) in each community, over one year before and throughout ED implementation. The investigators hypothesize that DUP will be reduced significantly in the early detection site compared to the usual detection site;
A secondary aim is to determine whether DUP reduction can augment the outcomes of established FES on outcomes in the U.S. The investigators will measure symptoms, functioning and engagement with treatment at entry and over 1 year at each site. The investigators hypothesize that shorter DUP at one FES (STEP) will predict reduced distress and illness severity at entry and better early outcomes at STEP compared to PREP.",STEP-ED: Reducing Duration of Untreated Psychosis and Its Impact in the U.S.,0,0,0,0,0,"['OTHER', 'NIH']","['Harvard University', 'National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)']","October 29, 2020",Anticipated,"['Psychosis', 'Schizophrenia']",D000019967,Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders,"['BXM', 'All']","['Behaviors and Mental Disorders', 'All Conditions']","['Psychosis', 'Psychosis', 'Schizophrenia']","['M3396', 'M13056', 'M13959', 'M20422']","['Mental Disorders', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders']","['high', 'high', 'high', 'low']","['D000012559', 'D000011618', 'D000001523']","['Schizophrenia', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Mental Disorders']",0,Non-Randomized,Parallel Assignment,0,None (Open Label),0,0,Treatment,0,0,"Early detection, or reducing the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) can substantially ameliorate the distress and disability caused by psychotic illnesses. The TIPS project in Scandinavia used a combination of public and targeted education campaigns coupled with rapid availability of comprehensive services to improve the identification, referral and early treatment of psychotic illness. By targeting the dual 'bottlenecks' of inadequate mental health literacy and delayed access to effective treatment, TIPS significantly reduced DUP2 and experimentally demonstrated improved clinical presentations and outcomes.

Effective service models for new onset psychosis exist in the U.S. Multi-element specialty 'first-episode' services (FES), highlighted in this FOA, provide care that is adapted to the specific needs of younger patients and their families and can improve symptoms and functional outcomes during the critical early phase of psychotic illnesses. The NIH-funded Specialized Treatment in Early Psychosis (STEP, New Haven) project, included the first U.S.-based randomized controlled trial to establish the feasibility and effectiveness of a public-sector approach to FES.5 The Prevention and Recovery in Early Psychosis (PREP, Boston) clinic has advanced a similar model of care within an analogous public-academic collaboration.

What is required, as the next logical step, is a test of the effectiveness of TIPS' powerful approach to early detection in a policy-relevant U.S. setting, where relatively fragmented pathways to care raise both the challenges and potential public health impact of early detection. The expertise within the investigators investigative team in the design of early detection and the presence of 2 similar, effective, geographically separated and collaborative FES programs (STEP and PREP) presents an excellent opportunity to conduct such a test and thereby advance secondary prevention for psychotic illnesses in the U.S.",0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

Severe aortic stenosis, defined as aortic valve area of < 1.0 cm2 (or aortic valve area index of < 0.6 cm2/m2) by the continuity equation, AND mean gradient > 40 mmHg or maximal aortic valve velocity > 4.0 m/sec by resting echocardiogram.

Subjects with low-flow/low gradient severe aortic stenosis can be included, provided low-dose dobutamine or exercise stress echocardiography demonstrates a mean gradient of > 40 mmHg or a maximal aortic valve velocity of > 4.0 m/sec, AND aortic valve area of < 1.0 cm2 (or aortic valve area index of < 0.6 cm2/m2).

Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score of ≥ 8 OR documented heart team agreement of ≥ high risk for aortic valve replacement due to frailty or co-morbidities.
Symptoms of aortic stenosis, AND New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II or greater.

The subject and the treating physician agree that the subject will return for all required post-procedure follow-up visits.

Exclusion Criteria:

Any condition considered a contraindication for placement of a bioprosthetic valve (e.g. subject is indicated for mechanical prosthetic valve).

A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following which cannot be adequately pre-medicated:

aspirin or heparin (HIT/HITTS) and bivalirudin
ticlopidine and clopidogrel
Nitinol (titanium or nickel)
contrast media
Blood dyscrasias as defined: leukopenia (WBC < 1000 mm3), thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50,000 cells/mm3), history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, or hypercoagulable states.
Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease requiring revascularization.
Severe left ventricular dysfunction with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 20% by echocardiography, contrast ventriculography, or radionuclide ventriculography.
End stage renal disease requiring chronic dialysis or creatinine clearance < 20 cc/min.
Ongoing sepsis, including active endocarditis.
Any percutaneous coronary or peripheral interventional procedure with a bare metal or drug eluting stent performed within 30 days prior to study procedure.
Symptomatic carotid or vertebral artery disease or successful treatment of carotid stenosis within 10 weeks of Heart Team assessment.
Cardiogenic shock manifested by low cardiac output, vasopressor dependence, or mechanical hemodynamic support.
Recent (within 6 months of Heart Team assessment) cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA).
Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding that would preclude anticoagulation.
Subject refuses a blood transfusion.
Severe dementia (resulting in either inability to provide informed consent for the study/procedure, prevents independent lifestyle outside of a chronic care facility, or will fundamentally complicate rehabilitation from the procedure or compliance with follow-up visits).
Estimated life expectancy of less than 12 months due to associated non-cardiac co-morbid conditions.
Other medical, social, or psychological conditions that in the opinion of the investigator precludes the subject from appropriate consent or adherence to the protocol required follow-ups exams.
Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study (excluding registries).
Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction ≤ 30 days before the study procedure.
Need for emergency surgery for any reason.
Liver failure (Child-Pugh class C).

The intervention will target active heroin and crack users and consists of increasing access to HIV testing via a social network HIV testing component and reducing sexual and drug use risk via a peer network brief behavioral Intervention. Encuentro also consists of conducting community awareness meeting to target structural factors affecting HIV risk. The intervention was developed in an area severely affected by violence and stigma towards drug users, El Salvador, which makes it particularly suitable for adaptation to meet the needs of drug users living in the proposed intervention site, the U.S.-Mexico border. The proposed intervention site also has been severely affected by violence which has curtailed any prior attempts to reduce the risk drug users' HIV risk. Violence has worsened structural factors which affect HIV risk such as, increasing police persecution and stigma and reducing access to resources. In our proposed project, we will engage in formative research to understand the context of HIV risk of drug users in the border region post violence and adapt the intervention accordingly. Findings will allow the investigators to tailor intervention components to meet the needs of drug users in the region. Subsequently, the investigators propose to test intervention effectiveness and evaluate implementation barriers and facilitators. To accomplish project aims we will use a mixed qualitative, quantitative approach. The investigators will begin with a formative phase by conducting in-depth interviews with drug users (n = 40) living in the region to understand how the context of drug use risk changed as a result of the violence and will administer a social network survey (n = 200) to characterize the configuration of risk networks. Findings will yield the necessary information to culturally adapt the intervention to meet the needs of drug users in the region and will help the investigators focus recruitment efforts where the riskiest networks are located. After the intervention is adapted with the help of the community advisory boards and the community coalitions, the investigators will implement the intervention and will assess the effectiveness and reach via 6 cross-sectional surveys administered to drug users (n=1,200). The investigators will assess the process of implementation by conducting ethnographic field notes of all intervention activities including community engagement and Community Advisory Board and coalition meetings. The investigators will assess the fidelity and quality of the intervention. Lastly, the investigators will conduct key informant interviews with key stakeholders involved in the project and interviews and observations will be coded to reflect key systems factors related to successful implementation of intervention components in two intervention sites (El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico). Findings will be highly significant as the investigators will be conducting parallel research on the effectiveness of interventions shown to be effective in Latino drug users in two very different contexts: El Salvador and the U.S-Mexico border. Findings will elucidate implementation challenges and barriers and such information can then be used to assess the effectiveness of diverse implementation strategies in organizations working to serve the needs of Latino drug users.",Adaptation and Implementation of Project Encuentro in the U.S.-Mexico Border,"['jul416@lehigh.edu', 'rebeca@utep.edu']","['Julia Lechuga, PhD', 'Rebeca Ramos, MPH']","['6107584328', '9155842875']",0,"['Contact', 'Contact']","['UNKNOWN', 'UNKNOWN']","['Alliance of Border Collaboratives', 'Programa Compañeros']",April 2021,Anticipated,Risk Behavior,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Non-Randomized,Single Group Assignment,Quasi experimental design repeated time series analysis,None (Open Label),0,0,Prevention,0,0,"The intervention framework of the proposed Intervention is exerting change at multiple levels, through community based approaches. At the structural level, the investigators propose to increase the access to HIV testing of high risk drug users and to create change at the community level regarding factors that influence the risk of drug users such as stigma towards drug use and HIV among other topics. At the individual level, the investigators propose to modify normative beliefs around risky behaviors in a social network and hence, effecting change in participants by changing normative behavior around safer sexual encounters, HIV testing, and reduced risk in injection and non-injection drug use. Following, strategies to be employed in each intervention component are delineated.

Social Network HIV Testing Component. To prepare for the rolling-out of the social network HIV testing component (during month 6 of year 2), the investigators will convene a two day training with partner organizations from both sides of the border to train staff on the social network referral methodology. Research staff will initiate the recruitment of seeds by recruiting four to six seeds per city. Counselors, at the partner organizations, will begin by administering a rapid HIV test and provide pre and post-test counseling to seeds. Counselors, who will be trained in the social network assessment methodology, will then ask seeds to list other drug users in their social network who they believe are at risk of contracting HIV. Counselors will then provide participants with 3 coupons to recruit identified network members for an HIV test. Referred participants who engage in high-risk behavior will be also provided with 3 coupons to refer their own network members for an HIV test. Whenever social network HIV testing rates slow, research staff will re-seed in the communities to begin the recruitment process again. Counselors will make appointments for all participants who test positive for confirmatory HIV testing at the respective local governmental health care institutions. A research staff will follow-up with HIV positive participants to engage them in care. Throughout the duration of the project, monthly meetings will be convened between research staff involved in the project to ascertain that procedures are being followed and retrain if the need arises. The social network component of the intervention will continue until month 12 of year 5.

The Peer Network Intervention. During month 1 of year 4, we will roll-out the peer network behavioral intervention. Two peer leaders will be selected from each city to deliver the intervention sessions. Eligibility criteria will be being former drug users, having extensive contacts, high degree of trust among peers, and motivation and demonstrated ability to work fixed hours. During month 12 of year 3, training sessions, in collaboration with partner organization, will be conducted to train peer leaders over the course of two weeks during ten training sessions lasting 3 hours per session. Peer leaders will be trained in the curriculum as well as in psychosocial theory as the basis for behavioral interventions, interactive group management, HIV risk reduction, effective instruction for role-plays, and social network recruitment methods. Peer leaders will recruit drug users they know who will be asked, in turn, to recruit other drug users in their networks. If this initial contact is unable to recruit network members, peer leaders will select other initial contact. Peer leaders will deliver the intervention to 300 drug users (150 per border city) in cycles composed of small social networks of 5-6 drug users. Four intervention cycles will be held per month and will consist of 3 consecutive sessions of 2 hours in duration delivered in the early afternoon. Peer leaders will be expected to comply with a fixed work schedule of 10 hours per week and will be asked to actively recruit social networks for each intervention cycle. Although we expect the specific information and roles plays to change based on the findings of our formative phase and our sessions of acceptability and feasibility with our CAB and coalition, the peer network intervention will have the following structure. The first session of the intervention will cover training in social contexts of risk and strategies to avoid them through role plays, techniques for harm reduction for injection and non-injection drug use, and available community resources to deal with substance abuse. The second session will provide information about HIV and Sexually Transmitted Diseases through games, didactic sessions, and exercises to rank the risk of contracting HIV from various behaviors, negotiation skills for condom use in situations of high risk such as exchange of sex for drugs. The third session will consist of training in advocacy and sexual rights and establishment of a personal and social network risk reduction plan. Ethnographers will be trained to document the process of delivery such as number of participants per intervention cycle. Research staff will attend one intervention session per cycle to assess intervention fidelity. Weekly meetings will be held with peer leaders and research staff to discuss problems, solutions, and planning of community wide events.

Community-Wide Events. The community coalition in collaboration with the CAB and peer leaders will be asked to plan and convene educational meetings at the community level with drug and non-drug users to deliver information on topics such as drug use prevention and treatment, HIV and risk reduction skills, and other issues affecting the HIV risk of communities such as persecution of drug users by police, human rights violations, and sexual violence. They will identify experts on topics identified and invite them as guest speakers.",0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

If you have breast cancer and you agree to take part in this study, you will be interviewed by a trained interviewer with a questionnaire at a time convenient for you, either during your visit to MD Anderson or The Rose, or by phone. You will be asked questions about your personal demographics (such as your age and race), environmental exposures, medical history, family history of cancer, and other day-to-day lifestyle factors. It should take about 30-40 minutes to complete the interview. Clinical data about your breast cancer treatment will also be collected from your medical records.

You will also have a one-time blood draw (about 3 tablespoons). If blood cannot be drawn or not enough blood can be drawn, you will have a saliva sample taken where you will be required to spit into a container. If you have already donated blood or a saliva sample in the Mexican-American Cohort Study, a portion of that sample may be used instead of having to collect a new sample. Your blood or saliva sample will be used to look at your DNA (genetic material of cells). The study pathologist will look at possible prognostic markers (substances that predict outcome of disease) from tissue obtained from your surgery.

Neither you nor your regular doctor will receive reports of this research study. The results of this research study will not be placed in your health records. All of your information obtained in this study will be kept confidential either in a password-protected computer or in a locked file cabinet in a secure location.

The occurrence of PTSD in the military is on the rise. This has significantly impacted military members, their families, and society as a whole. According to an expert panel convened by the Institute of Medicine in 2007, the effectiveness of most currently employed PTSD therapies is low. Safe and effective treatments are urgently needed. The specific aim of this investigation is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel approach to relieve PTSD symptoms, utilizing a procedure commonly used in pain management, a Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB) with local anesthesia. Male soldiers experiencing moderate to severe symptoms of PTSD will be recruited for evaluation of Stellate Ganglion Block with local anesthesia as an intervention for PTSD treatment. Participants will be randomized to receive either the SGB with local anesthesia to C6 tubercle or a sham procedure involving a subcutaneous saline injection to the neck. The PTSD symptoms before and after the procedure will be measured using a comprehensive clinician-administered scale, self-report measures, objective measures of cognitive ability, and physiologic reactivity measures. Subjects will undergo assessment prior to the procedure, one week following the procedure, one month and 3 months following the procedure. Patients receiving sham injections will be allowed to cross over to the treatment group. Based on published case reports of Lipov et al in Chicago and Mulvaney et al from Walter Reed Medical Center, who utilized this technique to successfully treat soldiers with combat-related PTSD, we predict that the use of Stellate Ganglion Block will result in reduction of PTSD symptoms as measured by clinician-administered scales, self-report measures, objective measures of cognitive ability, and physiologic reactivity measures, leading to a significant and lasting reduction of PTSD symptoms.","A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Stellate Ganglion Block in the Treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,April 2016,Actual,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),"['D000010335', 'D000068099', 'D000001523']","['Pathologic Processes', 'Trauma and Stressor Related Disorders', 'Mental Disorders']","['BXM', 'All', 'BC04', 'BC17', 'BC26']","['Behaviors and Mental Disorders', 'All Conditions', 'Cancers and Other Neoplasms', 'Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Wounds and Injuries']","['Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Traumatic Stress Disorder']","['M14686', 'M23503', 'M24190', 'M14941', 'M16268', 'M222', 'M3396', 'M13056']","['Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic', 'Stress Disorders, Traumatic', 'Ganglion Cysts', 'Synovial Cyst', 'Wounds and Injuries', 'Trauma and Stressor Related Disorders', 'Mental Disorders', 'Psychotic Disorders']","['high', 'high', 'low', 'low', 'low', 'low', 'low', 'low']","['D000004194', 'D000040921', 'D000013313']","['Disease', 'Stress Disorders, Traumatic', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic']",0,Randomized,Crossover Assignment,0,Double,0,0,Treatment,0,"['Participant', 'Outcomes Assessor']",0,0,0,0,0,"Gender: Male and Female

The study was part of an Institute-initiated Request for Applications (RFA) titled ""Cost-Effective Strategies of Cholesterol-Lowering"" released by the NHLBI in 1990. The RFA was stimulated by the controversy concerning costs and cost-effectiveness that followed the 1987 report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults. The RFA was intended to support a broad and thorough quantitative exploration of the potential health benefits and costs of cholesterol-lowering from multiple perspectives.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The study added to the CHD Policy Model the capability to model the consequences of reductions in LDL cholesterol and increases in HDL/LDL ratios in the United States population. The CHD Policy Model was used for several studies, including: to compare the implications of using alternative epidemiologic studies as the basis for estimating the association between cholesterol levels and CHD risk; to derive cutting points for initiating cholesterol reduction, specific to age, sex, and CHD risk factors, and based on cost-effectiveness criteria; to compare the cost-effectiveness of specific targeted and population-wide strategies for cholesterol reduction; to incorporate the effects of treatments on quality of life, including both adverse effects of cholesterol-lowering drugs and reductions in CHD morbid events; and finally, to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of cholesterol screening, incorporating costs of screening, effects of measurement error on misclassification of patients, and variations in individual cholesterol levels over time.

People from all over the world take medications to treat HIV infection. These medicines work well in some people but not in others, and they cause harmful side effects in some people and not in others. These differences may be related to variations in how much of the drug reaches the blood. Differences in drug blood levels among people in various areas of the world may be attributed to differences in diet, state of health, ability to absorb the medicines from the stomach, ability to eliminate the drugs from the body, and the brand of medicine taken. This study will help scientists learn whether differences in blood levels of HIV medicines are important in determining how well the drugs work in different patient populations.

HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older in the United States and in Kampala, Uganda who have been on an antiretroviral treatment regimen that includes at least 28 consecutive days of nevirapine may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests.

Participants will have a total of approximately about 5 ounces of blood drawn during this 6- to 8-hour study. They will come to the NIH clinic in the morning, and a catheter (plastic tube) will be inserted into an arm vein for collecting blood. (Alternatively, blood can be collected by a needle inserted into an arm vein.) Blood will be withdrawn according to the following schedule:

About 5 tablespoons will be collected upon arrival at the clinic after an overnight fast. Within 30 minutes of this blood draw, the patient will have breakfast and take his or her morning dose of nevirapine, along with any other medications that need to be taken at that time.
1 tablespoon of blood will be drawn 2 hours after the nevirapine dose.
1 tablespoon of blood will be drawn 4 hours later (6 hours after the nevirapine dose).

The blood will be analyzed for levels of nevirapine and possibly other HIV medicines. Some of the blood will be stored for later analysis of genes (cytochrome P450 and MDR1) that are involved in eliminating medicines from the body.

As such, recent efforts have focused on providing antiretroviral pharmacotherapy to this population. However, there are a number of factors indigenous to non-Western HIV-infected patients that may alter their virologic, immunologic, and/or toxicologic response to antiretroviral therapy. Absorption, distribution, and clearance of antiretroviral medications may differ among patients residing in non-Western countries secondary to dietary influences, parasitic infection, and malabsorption. Genetic polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes (cytochrome P450; CYP) and drug transporters (i.e. P-glycoprotein) may also contribute to altered pharmacokinetics among these patients. The purpose of this pilot, hypothesis-generating study is (1) to characterize the pharmacokinetics of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine in a non-Western HIV-infected population (Kampala, Uganda) and in a similar cohort of HIV-infected individuals in the United States and (2) to compare pharmacokinetic parameter values between the groups. Twenty-five subjects from each site will participate. Subjects from the Ugandan site may participate regardless of their CD4+ lymphocyte count and viral load; they will be studied prior to the U.S. cohort. The U.S. group will be selected to include subjects that are matched by gender to their Ugandan counterparts. Subjects will have one pre-dose and two post-dose blood samples collected for the determination of nevirapine plasma concentrations. Samples will be analyzed using LC/MS-MS. Population pharmacokinetics parameter values (Cmax, Cmin, AUC, CL/F, Vd) will be determined using NONMEM(Trademark) and compared between groups.

Biotherapies, including anti-TNF alpha have demonstrated effectiveness by several randomized clinical trials. The long-term use in clinical practice raise several questions regarding their safety, the risk-benefit ratio, and the actual advantage of such treatment in real life routine practice. Moreover such practice may considerably change, as far as increasing number of therapies are made available on the market.

On request form national health authorities in France, this phase 4 study will help monitor the changing strategies of prescription, the effectiveness and safety of these drugs.

Objectives :

to determine the impact of biotherapy prescription in 3 category of diseases assessed on articular, functional and quality of life outcomes, as well as other drug consumption, and to monitor adverse events
to determine the place of biotherapy in the sequence of treatments of patients

Study design:

In Latin America, 16 to 18 million individuals are thought to have Chagas' disease and 90 million are considered to be at risk of infection. In the United States, the occurrence of Chagas' disease is virtually limited to individuals who have resided in Latin America where they acquired the infection, and then migrated to this country.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Data on the prevalence of positive serologic reactions for Trypanosoma cruzi (a protozoan causing Chagas cardiomyopathy) serve for calculating that a total of up to 74,000 Latin Americans residing in the United States have the chronic form of chagasic cardiomyopathy. The vast majority of these individuals are either undiagnosed, or misdiagnosed as having idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or coronary artery disease. Vector transmission of T. cruzi infection is very unlikely to occur in the United States because of variations in biological behavior of local species of insect vectors and because of changes in human living conditions. Transfusion of blood from infected but asymptomatic individuals is considered the most important mechanism of transmission of this disorder in the United States.

The organism can infect many different vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, but mostly rodents and lagomorphs. Transmission to humans is generally via an insect vector, such as ticks, mosquitoes, and biting flies, or from handling contaminated animal products or carcasses. F. tularensis is a highly infectious bacterium, with human infection and disease occurring with as few as 10 organisms, and mortality rates approaching 30 percent if untreated. Clinical presentation of tularemia varies in severity depending on the virulence of the organism, the route of entry, the extent of system involvement, and the immune status of the host. Following an incubation period of 3 to 5 days, individuals have an abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, malaise, anorexia, and fatigue. The clinical presentation of the disease can include one or more the following forms: ulceroglandular (the most common form of the disease), glandular, oculoglandular, pharyngeal, gastrointestinal, pneumonic or typhoidal. This study is a Phase II, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, trial comparing the safety and immunogenicity of a Francisella tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) vaccine produced by DynPort Vaccine Company (DVC-LVS) to a LVS vaccine in use by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID-LVS). Study Group A will include 110 volunteers who will be vaccinated with a single dose of the DVC LVS product in one arm and normal saline (NS) control in the other arm on Day 0. Group B will include 110 volunteers who will be vaccinated with a single dose of the USAMRIID-LVS product in one arm and normal saline (NS) control in the other arm on Day 0. Both vaccines will be administered by scarification. Approximately 100 microliters aliquot will be withdrawn and placed on the skin, a bifurcated needle will then be used to puncture the skin 15 times through the droplet. The primary objectives are: (Safety): assess the frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) and Grade 3 and 4 laboratory values following vaccination with either DVC-LVS or USAMRIID-LVS vaccine; (Take): assess the frequency of ""take"" (defined as the development of an erythematous papule, vesicle, and/or eschar with or without underlying induration) following vaccination with either the DVC-LVS or USAMRIID-LVS vaccine; and (Immunogenicity): assess the rate of seroconversion following vaccination with either the DVC-LVS or the USAMRIID-LVS vaccine as measured by a tularemia-specific microagglutination assay. The secondary objectives are: (Safety): assess the incidence of adverse events (AEs) following vaccination with either the DVC-LVS or the USAMRIID-LVS vaccine; (Take): assess ""take"" frequency and difference between vaccine groups as assessed by an independent committee following vaccination with either the DVC-LVS or USAMRIID- LVS vaccine; and (Immunogenicity): assess antibody responses for each group following vaccination with DVC-LVS or USAMRIID-LVS vaccine as measured by a tularemia-specific microagglutination assay.

This trial is conducted in collaboration with Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS) investigators in Bangkok, Thailand, who will be recruiting adult blood donors from a pool of patients who present with active P. vivax infections in Thailand. Samples of P. vivax infected blood will be collected and fed via membrane feeding apparatus to colony-reared Anopheles dirus mosquitoes at the AFRIMS Entomology Lab. A portion of the same blood will meanwhile be screened for potential co-infections at the AFRIMS Retrovirology Laboratory. When screening tests have confirmed the presence of only P. vivax in the blood (no co-infections with other malaria species), and selected dissection on days 3-7 has revealed oocyst production in the blood-fed mosquitoes, the mosquitoes will be transported from the AFRIMS insectary in Thailand to the WRAIR insectary in the US by a standard procedure (herein described) including permits and assurance against accidental release of the infected mosquitoes. Transport will be conducted in compliance with Thai exporting and US importing requirements.

Participants in the study described herein (Groups 2-4, n = ~60) will be exposed to ~50 hours of sleep restriction , after which time eight suction blisters will be induced on one forearm and immune responsiveness and skin barrier restoration time recorded.

In 1985 when the study was initiated, there were surprisingly little data on the distribution of risk factors among subgroups of the population and the changes occurring over time. These issues assumed greater importance as the decline in coronary heart disease mortality focused interest on the role of primary prevention through alteration of risk factors. In review of the potential contributions to this decline, it was noted that cessation of cigarette smoking, better blood pressure control and decrease in total serum cholesterol may have accounted partially for the decline in coronary heart disease mortality. However, these observations overlooked the possibility that observations in the total population or confined to specific socioeconomic groups may fail to disclose differential changes in particular population segments. For example, Americans in the higher educational and income groups experienced rapid and marked changes in risk behaviors while less educated, lower income Americans or specific racial/ethnic groups experienced no beneficial changes. The majority of cohort studies followed rather select groups and most cross-sectional surveys also had little sociodemographic variability. However, focusing public health, educational and medical intervention efforts required that particular groups at greater risk or experiencing less beneficial secular change be identified and targeted for greater efforts.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Trends in blood pressure, serum lipids, and cigarette smoking were described in nationally representative samples of adolescents ages 12 to 17 and in young adults ages 18 to 24 using data from surveys conducted from 1960 to 1984 by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Trends in blood pressure, serum lipids, cigarette smoking, and obesity were described in nationally representative samples of older adults ages 35 to 75 using NCHS survey data. The national surveys used included National Health Examination Surveys (NHES-I and III), the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES I and II) and Hispanic NHANES. The secular trends in these risk factors were contrasted by subgroupings of age, race, sex, family income, and education. The correlates of these risk factors were determined and secular changes over time were identified and quantified. Risk factor values and their correlates in the national population sample were contrasted with the three Hispanic populations surveyed in the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). Statistical methodologies were refined including statistical software for the analysis of complete sample survey data, model fitting strategies to characterize the secular trends across four national surveys, and guidelines for the choice of analytical strategies.

This randomized clinical trial will compare the efficacy of a culturally-tailored healthy food budgeting, purchasing, and cooking program on: (1) diet quality (i.e., intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, processed foods) and (2) healthy food budgeting and cooking skills, among AIs with type 2 diabetes who reside in a large AI community in the north-central United States. Additionally, the investigators will conduct a mixed methods process evaluation to assess intervention reach, fidelity, and participant satisfaction. Curriculum will be tailored to an AI population with diabetes, and directly address major barriers to healthy eating that were identified by community members and tribal leaders in recent focus groups including: (1) difficulty budgeting for food on low-incomes; (2) low literacy and numeracy when purchasing food (e.g., inability to use in-store scales to convert foods priced ""per pound"" to dollar values); (3) limited cooking skills. The investigators expect that implementation of a culturally-tailored diet intervention will be effective in promoting positive diet change, and increase healthy food budgeting and cooking skills.

Poorly controlled diabetes affects the health/longevity of those afflicted, and has profound effects on healthcare costs. Greater efforts are needed to encourage healthy eating in underserved communities with a high burden of diabetes. Improving healthy food budgeting, purchasing, and cooking skills among AIs with diabetes should improve diet and diabetes management.

Tinnitus can result from exposure to continuous noise from vehicles, generators, and other equipment, and from blast, or impulse noise from friendly-or opposing-forces weapon systems. Thus, tinnitus caused by both long-term noise exposure and acute acoustic trauma is an obstacle to be overcome in return-to-duty decisions and represents a serious liability to the retention of a healthy and fit force. Until recently, there has been no treatment that has been clinically validated as consistently effective. The development of the Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment sought to overcome the practical limitations of previously available approaches (e.g. tinnitus maskers and biofeedback). While these studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment over alternative therapies, these trials studied target populations that may not be representative of the typical Soldier experiencing tinnitus.

Tinnitus, defined as the perception of sound when no corresponding external auditory stimulus exists, is a debilitating condition that is widespread yet difficult to successfully treat. It is estimated that between 10% and 15% of the adult population experience tinnitus to some degree. Although many people with tinnitus are not disturbed by the sensation, the condition is disabling in 0.5% to 2% of the tinnitus population or between 1.4 and 5 million people (Bauer & Brozoski, 2006). Additionally, tinnitus is among the most prevalent of service-connected disabilities for veterans receiving compensation according to the VA 2010 Annual Benefits Report, impacting over half a million veterans (US Department of Veterans Affairs, 2010).

The impact of tinnitus on a patient's quality of life can be devastating (Tyler & Baker, 1983). Many patients report that the intrusive perception of sound - such as ringing, roaring, or buzzing - interferes with their ability to relax, sleep and concentrate, especially in quiet situations. Many tinnitus patients also report reduced tolerance of loud sounds, and will tend to avoid noisy (e.g. social) situations. The disturbing effects of the condition can lead to a desperate sense of loss of control.

Until recently, there has been no treatment that has been clinically validated as consistently effective. Despite advances in understanding of the tinnitus condition, such as the Neurophysiological Model (Jastreboff & Hazell, 1993), the promise of much improved outcomes from treatment has yet to be realized in general clinical practice. Previously available treatment options continue to be limited by a lack of clinically consistent efficacy, efficiency, and/or user acceptability. Even Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT), the most widely advocated practical application of the principles of the Neurophysiological Model, has been recently reported to yield only modest outcomes, and to require an extended period of time (up to 24 months) to achieve these outcomes for a high proportion of patients (J. A. Henry et al., 2005). Notably, some reports (Dineen, Doyle, Bench, & Perry, 1999; Hiller & Haerkotter, 2005; McKinney, Hazell, & Graham, 1999; Schmitt & Kroner-Herwig, 2002; Tyler, 2004) have questioned whether the acoustic stimulation used in tinnitus management programs such as TRT, predominantly consisting of broadband noise generators or hearing aids, provides any real incremental benefit over the counseling component of the program.

Furthermore, hearing aids and noise generators have been shown to provide limited clinical benefits when used in tinnitus management programs (Hiller & Haerkotter, 2005; Moffat et al., 2009), and these technologies are further limited by problems with user acceptability. Many tinnitus sufferers report that they find hearing aids intolerable to wear due to their decreased sound tolerance together with the unpredictability of amplified ambient sounds. Similarly, many people fitted with noise generators find the sound they produce unpleasant to listen to for the extended periods each day for which their use is recommended. As a result, for both hearing aids and noise generators, return-for-credit and ""left-unused-in-the-drawer"" rates are very high (J.A. Henry, Schecthter, Nagler, & Fausti, 2002; Hiller & Haerkotter, 2005).

Recent research into the pathogenesis of tinnitus has emphasized the role of neurological changes that result from damage to the auditory system (Tyler, 2005). These changes include the brain's adaptive response to auditory starvation (leading to increased sensitivity in the system), the initial perception of sound, and the systems within the brain that determine the person's attention and reaction to it.

The Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment Program (NTTP) takes into account the neural plasticity that underlies tinnitus and targets the neurological changes that cause it. It utilizes an acoustic stimulus that combines music with an embedded neural stimulus, which are spectrally modified and customized for each patient's hearing and tinnitus profile. By accounting for a patient's hearing loss, the NTTP provides a broadband neural stimulus to stimulate the neural pathways that are ""starved"" due to auditory damage and/or hearing loss. The NTTP stimulus also positively engages the limbic system to reduce the stress caused by the tinnitus.

A key benefit of the customization process is that it allows the stimulus to be used at a comfortably low listening level. By allowing for intermittent, momentary perception of the tinnitus within a pleasant and relaxing listening experience, it desensitizes the patient's reaction to the tinnitus, thereby leading to long-term reduction in tinnitus disturbance.

The NTTP has been clinically proven in civilian populations to : (1) reduce symptoms early in treatment, in particular, provide relief from the disturbing effects of the condition, (2) treat the neurological causes associated with tinnitus, (3) provide long-term relief and improvements in quality of life, and (4) be convenient and noninvasive.

The NTTP has been the subject of a series of published clinical studies with civilian subjects (P. B. Davis, 2005; P. B. Davis, Paki, & Hanley, 2007; P.B. Davis, Wilde, & Steed, 2002; P. B. Davis, Wilde, Steed, & Hanley, 2008; Hanley, Davis, Paki, Quinn, & Bellekom, 2008), which have demonstrated that it yields better results, more quickly, more consistently, and with an intervention that is more acceptable to the patient than prior approaches. Included among these clinical studies was a comparative study (P. B. Davis et al., 2008) that showed that the Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment generates significantly greater and more consistent improvements in tinnitus symptoms than a treatment comprised of counseling plus broad band noise ('white noise') and better outcomes than counseling-alone.

While the efficacy of the NTTP has been demonstrated, it remains an expensive and somewhat time-consuming treatment strategy. A previous study (Karch, Hill, Casto, Nedostup, & Staton, 2014) indicated that a COTS sound therapy may also be an effective way to treat tinnitus. Preliminary analysis of subjective tinnitus measures from Karch (2014) indicates that the NTTP strategies were effective at reducing the negative effects of tinnitus (i.e. reduction in subjective effects of tinnitus as measured by the Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire (TRQ), tinnitus awareness time, and tinnitus disturbance time). Similar results were seen with a COTS group, with statistically significant differences in pre- and post-treatment measures of TRQ and tinnitus awareness. Analysis of clinical measures associated with tinnitus suggest no differences between pre- and post-treatment on the masking level required to cover tinnitus or the level of loudness discomfort associated with tinnitus for either group. However, due to the small sample size and unequal groups, comparisons between the treatments in the Karch et al. study (2014) should be made cautiously.

Tinnitus is among the most prevalent medical complaints soldiers have when returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom/ Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF). Soldiers with clinically significant levels of tinnitus often suffer from anxiety, depression, sleep disruption, and difficulty concentrating. Currently, there is no standard tinnitus treatment protocol in the military system and limited clinical efficacy on the NTTP and COTS tinnitus treatment supported by a controlled study. The proposed research will attempt to definitively establish the value of the NTTP in a military setting.

The study stresses the return-to-duty of Soldiers experiencing severe tinnitus that might otherwise prevent these Soldiers from deploying with their units. Retention of a fit force and improved quality of life for active-duty Soldiers are important issues associated with a successful approach to the treatment of tinnitus.

OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS/RESEARCH QUESTIONS

The objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of individualized sound stimuli used in a FDA classified tinnitus masker device, the Neuromonics, Inc. Oasis™.

Research Question: Is there a difference in clinical outcomes for tinnitus patients treated with the NTTP compared with the same treatment using a placebo-control device? The placebo-control device is otherwise identical to the NTTP device except that the sound stimuli are not matched to the patients' audiograms and tinnitus profile and are not specifically designed to promote relaxation. Assignment of tinnitus patients to the treatment and placebo groups is performed off site and the experimenters have no information on group assignment.

Hypothesis: In the Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard military and recently separated veteran populations with complaints of tinnitus, the NTTP group will have significantly improved tinnitus clinical outcomes in comparison to placebo-control group at 6 months. Clinical outcomes are described in Section B5.4 and Table 1 below.

Null Hypothesis: In the Active Duty, Reserve, and National Guard military and recently separated veteran populations with complaints of tinnitus, the NTTP group will have tinnitus clinical outcomes statistically indistinguishable from the placebo-control group at 6 months.",0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

However, military combat rations must meet rigorous shelf-stability guidelines (e.g.,, 3 years at 80°F or 6 months at 100°F), which is problematic for natural food sources of n-3s (e.g., oil and fish), which degrade when exposed to high temperatures and prolonged shelf-storage. Encapsulation, e.g., coating freeze dried n-3s with gelatin, can prevent this degradation, and Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center's (NSRDEC) Combat Feeding Directorate used encapsulated n-3 technology to produce n-3 enriched ration items that withstand environmental stressors and meet shelf-life specifications for military rations. However, the bioavailability of the encapsulated n-3s in these rations is unknown, particularly when they are incorporated into high-protein food items and exposed to high temperatures and prolonged storage. In this randomized, cross-over study, civilian and/or military personnel will be asked to consume: 1) a high protein food item enriched with encapsulated n-3s (600 mg) and previously stored for 6 months at 100°F; 2) a low-protein food item enriched with encapsulated n-3s (600 mg) and previously stored for 6 months at 100°F; 3) a high protein food item with encapsulated n-3s (600 mg) that was not subjected to high-temperature and prolonged storage; and, 4) a low-protein food item with encapsulated n-3s (600 mg) that was not subjected to high temperature and prolonged storage. Serial blood sampling to measure acute changes in the circulating fatty acid profile will occur in the hour before and 6 hours after consumption of each ration component.

The two methods of sampling are: 1) Using forceps that take biopsies (small tissue samples) from your esophagus, and 2) Using a brush that also takes biopsies from your esophagus.

By recording the results of all of your biopsies over many years, it may be possible to find out if the brush biopsy, forceps biopsy, or both can predict which patients with heartburn develop Barrett's esophagus, (an abnormality in the esophagus that may lead to cancer), and which patients with Barrett's esophagus develop precancer and cancer. The data from your biopsies will be used to determine the best way to diagnose esophageal disease.

The condition is most commonly diagnosed in the lumbosacral spinal segments L3-S1. The condition often starts with an injury to the disc space. The injury weakens the disc and creates excessive motion at the corresponding vertebral level. Over time, the segmental instability and associated neurological compromise combined with ongoing inflammatory processes that occur in and around the disc produce low back pain. The reparative processes in the disc are poor, thus the painful symptoms can become chronic.

Premature degeneration at adjacent levels of the spine remains one of the more vexing problems facing spinal surgeons when advising relatively young people to consider lumbar fusion surgery. Stopping the motion changes the mechanics of the back (which is designed for motion and flexibility) and results in the transfer of the loads and stresses to the adjacent vertebral segments. It is therefore intuitive to pursue total disc replacement, which allows for the treatment of pain due to DDD while re-establishing motion and stability, load distribution, and restoring the disc height, as an alternative to spinal fusion surgery.

The study hypothesis is that military personnel receiving Total Disc Replacement will return to the same level of active duty performance as at the time of their most recent successful physical readiness test.",Clinical Outcomes of Lumbar Degenerative Disc Disease in Active-Duty U.S. Service Personnel,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,March 2011,Actual,Degenerative Disc Disease,"['D000001847', 'D000009140']","['Bone Diseases', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases']","['BC05', 'All']","['Muscle, Bone, and Cartilage Diseases', 'All Conditions']","['Degenerative Disc Disease', 'Disc Disease']","['M26992', 'M14502', 'M3708', 'M10680']","['Intervertebral Disc Degeneration', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Bone Diseases', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases']","['high', 'high', 'low', 'low']","['D000013122', 'D000055959']","['Spinal Diseases', 'Intervertebral Disc Degeneration']",0,N/A,Single Group Assignment,0,None (Open Label),0,0,Treatment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

Specific Aim #1: Evaluate the diagnostic utility of SWE in differentiating individuals with and without LBP. The investigators will also examine the interaction between tissue change and clinical improvement. The investigators hypothesize that individuals with LBP will have higher muscle stiffness (shear modulus) at rest and impaired (lower) stiffness during contraction than individuals without LBP.

Specific Aim #2: Evaluate the effectiveness of dry-needling in decreasing aberrant muscle stiffness in individuals with LBP. The investigators hypothesize that individuals with LBP that receive dry-needling will exhibit larger changes than both individuals with LBP that receive sham dry-needling and than individuals without LBP that receive dry-needling.

Traditional medical diagnosis based on static imaging strategies (e.g. MRI) has failed to improve management of this epidemic. Functional assessment of lumbar musculature using ultrasound imaging provides evidence of clinically relevant deficits in the lumbar multifidus (LM) muscle of patients with LBP, however such procedures are likely only valid within a narrow range of assessment conditions. Shear-Wave Elastography (SWE) is an evolving non-invasive ultrasound imaging technology capable of quantifying tissue stiffness (i.e., elasticity). Originally developed to improve diagnosis of soft tissue tumors, SWE is beginning to be used to as an alternative and more stable method of functional assessment of muscles.

This study will be the second project in a line of research aimed at improving the diagnosis, management, and treatment of patients with LBP using a new structural health monitoring technique called shear wave elastography (SWE). Since no previous studies had used SWE in the lumbar multifidus muscle, the initial project developed the measurement technique to be used with this device. We also established normative parameters, variance, and reliability estimates of SWE outcomes in asymptomatic individuals. A previous study, also performed at AMEDDC&S, found that individuals with LBP whom received dry needling to the lumbar multifidus muscle exhibited a reduction in pain and disability that was associated with an improved ability to contract the lumbar multifidus. The focus of this second project is to evaluate the diagnostic utility of SWE in individuals after routine low back injury and begin an initial investigation of it's ability to effectively guide physical therapy treatment with dry-needling as a relevant treatment intervention.",0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

Despite the availability of effective and safe anti-hypertensive drugs, 65% of subjects diagnosed with HTN do not have their blood pressure (BP) controlled (<140/90 mmHg). The overall incidence of resistant HTN, (defined as requiring 3 or more anti-hypertensive drugs, including a diuretic, to control BP) is estimated to be 15% of the hypertensive population. Consequently, there is a pressing unmet medical need to develop new classes of anti-hypertensive drugs that act on alternative pathways and further control BP and the associated cardiovascular risks in subjects.

The prevalence of HTN in African Americans in the United States is among the highest in the world, and HTN is more common in African Americans than in Caucasians. One of the risk factors for HTN is sodium sensitivity. There is a higher association of HTN with sodium sensitivity in African American subjects and other racial/ethnic groups who are overweight/obese.

Effective agents to treat HTN in this high-risk population are clearly needed.

Inhibition of brain APA, which converts Ang II into Ang III, has emerged as a novel anti hypertensive treatment, as demonstrated in several experimental animal models. QGC001's anti-hypertensive effect is in part due to: 1) a decrease in arginine vasopressin release in the blood circulation, increasing diuresis, which reduces the size of body fluid compartment; and 2) a reduction in the sympathetic tone, leading to subsequent decreases in vascular resistances.

The study could enroll up to 323 patients to ensure 75 converted subjects with 6 months of follow-up data. Converted subjects were followed at 30-days, 3-months, and 6-months post conversion. Subjects that were unable to undergo conversion were followed at 6-months post filter implant (permanent filtration subjects).

Study subjects were to be identified from the pool of candidates with a time-limited risk for pulmonary embolism. Subjects who signed the informed consent were evaluated to determine eligibility for the study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Following completion of baseline procedures including a bilateral Doppler ultrasound of the legs to assess for baseline DVT and contrast venacavography to assess baseline IVC diameter, subjects underwent implantation of the VenaTech Convertible filter.

After device implant, a clinical assessment was completed to determine eligibility for filter conversion. This assessment was done at an interval post-implant and frequency per the investigator's discretion, often with input from the primary care physician. If the clinician determined the subject was no longer at risk for pulmonary embolism, there was no thrombus in or below the filter, and there was no clinically significant deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the legs, the filter could be converted. After conversion, subjects were followed at 30 days and 3-months by telephone, and at a 6-months post-conversion office visit with imaging (KUB or spot film and Doppler or CT).

If during the conversion clinical assessment(s), the subject remained at risk for pulmonary embolism, additional conversion assessment(s) were completed per the investigator's discretion until the filter was either converted or the subject was determined to require permanent filtration.

At 6-months post-implant, if a study subject's filter had not been converted, no further conversion assessments were to be performed and no attempts were to be made to convert the filter as part of the study. The 6-month post filter implant visit was the final follow-up for nonconverted subjects, which also included imaging (KUB or spot film and Doppler or CT). The study protocol allowed the investigators flexibility as to the best IVC imaging modality based on the condition and anatomy of the subject.

The core laboratory reviewed all screening/baseline, filter implantation, conversion eligibility assessment, conversion, and 6-month follow-up images, with the exception of the ultrasounds. (The core laboratory recommended ultrasound images be evaluated by the expert sonographers at the sites). Additionally, any images taken as a result of a suspected filter-related adverse event or technical complication, with the exception of ultrasounds, were also sent to the core laboratory for review.",0,0,0,0,"Inclusion Criteria:

The subject is 18 years of age or older

The study will include 20 patients in phase I clinical study and additional 20 patients in phase II clinical study (or in the extension of the clinical study), which will fulfill inclusion criteria.

Treatment effectiveness will be evaluated by US or CT imaging, to detect early local recurrence of the disease. Long term effectiveness of the treatment will be evaluated by frequent and precise patient follow-up. During follow-up clinical examination, laboratory tests, tumor markers (Ca 19-9 and CEA) and US/CT imaging will be performed.
