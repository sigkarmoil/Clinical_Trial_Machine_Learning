The CCP uses scientifically grounded principles for guiding effective decision making and provider-client communication. Ten Title X clinics are randomly assigned to one of two conditions (5 clinics per condition): (1) treatment as usual (TAU) or (2) implementation of the CCP. Approximately 150 women are selected for study participation in each clinic, yielding about 1,400 participants (half control and half CCP). Immediately following their counseling session, women complete a computer-administered interview that serves as a fidelity check and permits evaluation of the effects of the CCP on variables associated with counseling satisfaction. All women are re-interviewed by phone 6 months later and 12 months later.

Researchers want to study how using the program affects tobacco use in soldiers, as compared to standard anti-tobacco programs.", "DetailedDescription": "Researchers in the M. D. Anderson Department of Behavioral Science are developing a new video game program for young U.S. Army service members. The game addresses stopping and preventing the use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Soldiers (ages 18-35 years) stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, who are not scheduled to be mobilized for a 13-month period, will be invited to take part in the study.\n\nThe Study Groups:\n\nIf you choose to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a type of study intervention. The personnel companies on-base have been randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to offer participating service members 1 of the following 2 programs: either the educational video game (called the \"intervention\"), or pamphlets on stopping tobacco use (called \"standard care\"). Each company will receive only 1 of the 2 programs, and all participating service members in the same company will receive the same program. Each company has an equal chance of being assigned to either program.\n\nIntervention:\n\nParticipants in the intervention group will have a month to use the educational anti-tobacco video game located in areas that will provide convenient access. The game will be made available using an arcade-type kiosk which houses the computer game. After playing the video game on the kiosk for three 30-minute sessions, you will then be given a CD-ROM disc of the game to use as needed. After finishing these three 30-minute computer sessions, you will also receive a series of printed materials that go along with the computer sessions.\n\nStandard Care:\n\nThe standard care participants will receive a self-help pamphlet about stopping and avoiding tobacco use, provided by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nBoth Intervention and Standard Care Groups:\n\nNo matter which group your company is assigned to, if you choose to take part, you will be asked to complete surveys by computer at 4 points throughout the study. The survey will include questions about tobacco use, such as how much tobacco you use, how many times you have tried to quit, how ready you are to quit, how dependent you are on nicotine, any withdrawal and breathing symptoms you experience, your level of alcohol use, and support from family and friends. Each survey should take about 30 minutes to complete.\n\nThe first surveys will take place at the start of study participation. The intervention group will complete the second survey right after finishing the program. The standard care group will complete this second survey at about the same time as the intervention group. Both groups will also complete the third and fourth surveys at 6- and 12-month follow-ups.\n\nYou will be asked to provide saliva samples at the 12-month follow-up visit. Researchers will use these saliva samples to measure the level of cotinine, a chemical in your saliva that is related to tobacco use. You will be asked to spit into a clean plastic container. A dipstick will be placed in the container for at least 30 minutes. After reading the dipstick and recording the result, the study staff will throw away the saliva sample right away.\n\nYou will also be told about the nicotine replacement therapy and other tobacco cessation services available at no cost through the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center (CRDAMC) Tobacco Cessation Program at Fort Hood. M. D. Anderson is collaborating with the CRDAMC Tobacco Cessation Program on this study.\n\nThis is an investigational study.

"DescriptionModule": {"BriefSummary": "This study will investigate patterns of Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV) in the United States and its potential impact on the U.S. population. KSHV is a newly discovered virus that is strongly associated with Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma. The high prevalence of KS and KSHV among HIV-infected homosexual men suggests sexual contact as a primary mode of transmission. Reports of non-sexual transmission in parts of Africa and the Mediterranean where Kaposi's sarcoma is endemic, and the identification of viral DNA in saliva and other bodily fluids, however, indicate the virus is also transmitted non-sexually. This study will:\n\nCompare the prevalence of KSHV among different demographic groups in the United States\nExamine the association between KSHV and high risk behaviors such as drug use (marijuana and cocaine), sexual behavior (age at first sexual intercourse and number of sexual partners), and medical risk factors (herpes simplex virus II, hepatitis B and hepatitis C)\nEstimate the prevalence of KSHV in the United States.\n\nData and blood samples for the study will be taken from the NHANES III survey. NHANES is a program of periodic surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. The survey is designed to provide national estimates of health status for the United States non-institutionalized civilian population by means of household interviews, standardized physical examinations, and blood sample collection and testing. NHANES III-the seventh in a series of national examination studies-was conducted from 1988 to 1994.\n\nThis study will use the HANES data to identify risks associated with a KSHV-positive blood test in the survey population. The study plans to include all 19,754 participants (67% of the 29,314 participants originally examined) for whom blood samples were collected and remain available.", "DetailedDescription": "Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) is the viral cause of Kaposi sarcoma. Although infection with this virus appears to be uncommon in the United States, the prevalence in the general population in uncertain, and routes for transmission are poorly characterized. This study makes use of questionnaire data and serum specimens obtained in the third National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHAnes III).

The recordings will be used for this study only.", "DetailedDescription": "Background:\n\nThe number of individuals who choose to travel out of their native country for medical treatment in the United States has been growing (Purnell & Paulanka, 1998). State-of-the art care for children with cancer or rare diseases is not available in all countries, especially those where the ubiquity of cancer is a new phenomenon (Granda-Cameron, 1999). Due to the proximity of Latin America and the growing numbers of Latinos already in the United States, many, though not all, of the international patients being treated in U.S. hospitals are from Spanish-speaking countries (Coatsworth, Duncan, Pantin, & Szapocznik, 2006). While there are benefits associated with obtaining care in the United States such as improved access to specialized medical services, barriers posed by linguistic and cultural differences may play a role in the provision of adequate care for these children and their families. Additional challenges associated with receiving care in another country include failure to adhere to medical regimen due to breakdowns in communication, increased stress upon the caregiver to navigate a foreign health system and adjust to a foreign culture, and being uprooted from supportive social networks and family members (Flores, Abreu, Schwartz, & Hill, 2000). Parents of children with more severe and/or complex diseases may find themselves settling in the United States at the cost of leaving behind loved ones and careers in their country of origin. Provision of optimal care for these patients includes addressing the adjustment needs of their families; the caregiver-patient relationship has a significant influence on the child s physical and psychological outcomes (Brown et al., 2008). Exploring the experiences and needs of internationalfamilies that come to the United States seeking medical care for their child may help health care centers to provide more appropriate resources and may improve the overall quality of culturally-sensitive care provided to these families.\n\nObjective: This is a pilot, exploratory study designed to obtain greater understanding about the unique experiences of international families, mostly Latino families, who choose to participate in clinical research or seek medical treatment in the United States. Due to the lack of research on this phenomenon, the study will utilize qualitative methods to extrapolate the main themes that characterize this experience. The end goal of the study is to identify unique risk and protective factors that link directly to feasible interventions, so that we can provide this growing population with the standard of care expected by the mission of the NIH.\n\nAims:\n\nTo identify factors affecting the decision by international caregivers to seek treatment in the United States, with a specific focus on how medical information is obtained and utilized in the decision-making process.\n\nTo explore the experience of international caregivers in adapting to the medical and social culture of the United States.\n\nTo explore the thoughts and concerns of international caregivers regarding termination of treatment and subsequent re-entry into their native country.\n\nTo identify the presence and kind of positive growth experiences that occur in international families seeking medical care in the United States\n\nTo develop a set of concrete risk and protective factors associated with this experience in order to link to feasible interventions.\n\n(The term caregiver in this protocol is used to encapsulate any individual, such as a parent, close relative, foster parent, or head of household, who attends to the needs of the ill child.)\n\nStudy Population:\n\nThis is a study taking place at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). All caregivers of a child between the ages of 0-25 from a foreign country who have traveled to the United States for the purpose of enrolling in a research protocol and/or seeking treatment for their child s medical condition will be invited to participate in this study. Caregivers who immigrated to the United States for reasons other than obtaining these services for their child s condition will not be eligible to enroll in this study. Given the present demographic populations at NIH, it is expected that participants will include, but not be limited to, individuals from the Caribbean, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Chile, Peru, Guatemala, and Mexico. This sampling frame ensures that the presence of black, white, and mixed race individuals will be represented, acknowledging ethnicities that are often overlooked in studies focusing specifically on the experience of a given ethnic or racial group.\n\nSocioeconomic situation of the families is expected to vary widely; at NIH, individuals who meet the criteria for this study are from all different socioeconomic strata and have varying levels of education.\n\nDesign:\n\nThis is a qualitative study that will utilize narrative interview techniques to gather data, and content analysis techniques to analyze data. Data will be gathered according to theories of saturation of content, while collecting sufficient data to ensure credibility and face validity (Mays & Pope, 2000).

medicine has changed a lot in the past decades.

It will take about a half hour. This will have questions about their work with nuclear medicine procedures. There will be questions about the kinds of procedures and how often they do them.\n\nParticipants will give a short work history.

Many radiopharmaceuticals and procedures used in previous decades are now obsolete and are being replaced by new and emerging radioisotopes and combined-modality and molecular imaging procedures. While improvements in imaging technologies and the introduction of certain radioisotopes have generally reduced patient exposure to radiation, nuclear medicine technologists have become increasingly specialized in these newer procedures and are performing these and other nuclear medicine procedures with increasing frequency. Furthermore, lead aprons are less effective in protecting workers during nuclear medicine procedures, specifically higher-energy procedures (e.g., positron emission tomography (PET)), compared to other radiation-related procedures, and are seldom used by technologists performing nuclear medicine. As a result, cumulative doses to nuclear medicine technologists are expected to have increased. We hypothesize that certified nuclear medicine technologists may experience higher risks of some radiation-related cancers and other adverse health outcomes compared to most other medical specialty groups. There is currently very little information about radiation-related risks associated with performing these procedures due, in part, to limited information on occupational doses associated with current nuclear medicine practices. To characterize organ-specific doses that could later be used to quantify risks for specific radiation-related disease outcomes, either directly (through subsequent follow-up) or indirectly (through risk projection methods), we plan to collect detailed work history information on nuclear medicine procedures and associated radiation safety practices, as well as badge doses, for a representative sample of 1,500 technologists certified in nuclear medicine in the U.S. This information will complement similar data collected in 2013-2014 from an independent sample of approximately 4,500 general radiologic technologists in the U.S. Radiologic Technologists Study (USRT) who had reported working with these procedures. However, unlike the USRT sample, the proposed sample is expected to be higher-risk, including only those workers with a specialty certification in nuclear medicine who will have been begun working with nuclear medicine procedures much earlier in their career, at ages associated with greater susceptibility to radiation-related carcinogenesis."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition": ["Brain Cancer", "Thyroid Cancer", "Circulatory Disease", "Breast Cancer"]}, "KeywordList": {"Keyword": ["Cohort Study", "Radiation", "Occupation"]}}, "DesignModule": {"StudyType": "Observational", "DesignInfo": {"DesignObservationalModelList": {"DesignObservationalModel": ["Cohort"]}, "DesignTimePerspectiveList": {"DesignTimePerspective": ["Prospective"]}}, "EnrollmentInfo": {"EnrollmentCount": "229", "EnrollmentType": "Actual"}}, "ArmsInterventionsModule": {"ArmGroupList": {"ArmGroup": [{"ArmGroupLabel": "US Nuclear Medicine Technologist", "ArmGroupDescription": "radiologic technologists certified in nuclear medicine"}]}}, "OutcomesModule": {"PrimaryOutcomeList": {"PrimaryOutcome": [{"PrimaryOutcomeMeasure": "U.S. nuclear medicine tecnologist", "PrimaryOutcomeDescription": "Cancer and other disease risks associated with occupational nuclear medicine radiation exposures", "PrimaryOutcomeTimeFrame": "2016-2022"}]}, "SecondaryOutcomeList": {"SecondaryOutcome": [{"SecondaryOutcomeMeasure": "Administer questionnaire", "SecondaryOutcomeDescription": "Collect data on nuclear medicine procedures performed, radioisotopes used, related work and safety practices, and places of employment over time.", "SecondaryOutcomeTimeFrame": "2016-2018"}, {"SecondaryOutcomeMeasure": "Obtain badge doses", "SecondaryOutcomeDescription": "Collect badge doses from the nation's largest commercial dosimetry provider for use in estimating occupational radiation exposures.", "SecondaryOutcomeTimeFrame": "2016-2019"}]}}, "EligibilityModule": {"EligibilityCriteria": "ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:\nTechnologists from the target population of approximately 25,000 individuals who were first certified in nuclear medicine technology in the U.S. after 1980, are currently alive and residing in the U.S., and are not participants of the USRT study.", "HealthyVolunteers": "No", "Gender": "All", "MinimumAge": "18 Years", "MaximumAge": "100 Years", "StdAgeList": {"StdAge": ["Adult", "Older Adult"]}, "StudyPopulation": "This is an occupational cohort of 35,593 U.S. nuclear medicine technologists certified by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologist or the Nuclear Medicine Technology Certification Board in 1980 or later.", "SamplingMethod": "Probability Sample"}, "ContactsLocationsModule": {"OverallOfficialList": {"OverallOfficial": [{"OverallOfficialName": "Cari M Kitahara", "OverallOfficialAffiliation": "National Cancer Institute (NCI)", "OverallOfficialRole": "Principal Investigator"}]}, "LocationList": {"Location": [{"LocationFacility": "University of Minnesota, School of Public Health Environmental Health Sciences", "LocationCity": "Minneapolis", "LocationState": "Minnesota", "LocationZip": "55455", "LocationCountry": "United States"}]}}, "ReferencesModule": {"ReferenceList": {"Reference": [{"ReferencePMID": "25811150", "ReferenceType": "background", "ReferenceCitation": "Drozdovitch V, Brill AB, Callahan RJ, Clanton JA, DePietro A, Goldsmith SJ, Greenspan BS, Gross MD, Hays MT, Moore SC, Ponto JA, Shreeve WW, Melo DR, Linet MS, Simon SL.

We propose to conduct a population-based case-control study of renal cell cancer in areas of the U.S. with a high proportion of African American residents. We will include two study centers and one data coordinating center and will recruit study participants over a period of four years. We plan to conduct in-person interviews with 2,100 cases (1,400 whites and 700 blacks) and 2,800 controls (1,400 each of whites and blacks) to elicit information on demographic background and history of exposures. A 40 ml blood sample will be collected from living cases and controls to measure certain environmental exposures and for genetic analyses. Two buccal cell samples will be collected from living cases and controls for genetic analyses. Tumor tissue blocks will be collected from as many cases as possible for assays of tumor mutations. Diagnostic slides will be collected for standardized reclassification of tumors into clear cell, papillary, and other histologic subtypes.

We propose to conduct a population-based case-control study of renal cell cancer two areas of the U.S. with a high proportion of African American residents: Detroit, Michigan (Wayne State University), and Chicago, Illinois (University of Illinois at Chicago). Westat, Inc. is the coordinating center. Participants are being recruited over a period of four years. A total of 2,100 cases (1,400 Caucasian Americans and 700 African Americans) and 2,800 controls (1,400 each of Caucasian and African Americans) will be recruited. In-person interviews are conducted with cases and controls to elicit information on demographic background and history of exposures. A 40 ml blood sample and a buccal cell sample are collected from cases and controls for genetic analyses. Tumor tissue blocks will be collected from as many cases as possible for assays of tumor mutations. Diagnostic slides will be collected for standardized reclassification of tumors into clear cell, papillary, and other histologic subtypes. Medical records for all cases will be reviewed for presenting symptoms, tumor stage, size and grade, and methods leading to diagnosis of renal cell cancer. Telephone interviews are conducted with the nest-of-kin of eligible cases who died before we could interview them. Permission is being sought from the next-of-kin to assess the case's medical records and obtain tumor tissue samples."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition": ["Kidney Cancer", "Renal Cell Carcinoma"]}, "KeywordList": {"Keyword": ["Case-Control Study", "Renal Cell Carcinoma", "Kidney Cancer", "Diet", "Occupation"]}}, "DesignModule": {"StudyType": "Observational", "DesignInfo": {"DesignObservationalModelList": {"DesignObservationalModel": ["Case-Control"]}, "DesignTimePerspectiveList": {"DesignTimePerspective": ["Retrospective"]}}, "EnrollmentInfo": {"EnrollmentCount": "2424", "EnrollmentType": "Actual"}}, "ArmsInterventionsModule": {"ArmGroupList": {"ArmGroup": [{"ArmGroupLabel": "Cases", "ArmGroupDescription": "African American patients with renal cancer from two geographic areas of the US"}, {"ArmGroupLabel": "Controls", "ArmGroupDescription": "African American participants without renal cancer from two geographic areas of the US"}]}}, "EligibilityModule": {"EligibilityCriteria": "INCLUSION CRITERIA - CASES:\n\nResidents of the study areas who are diagnosed with histologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma at ages 20 to 79 years over a four year study will be potentially eligible for the study.\n\nIn addition, only eligible patients who are mentally/physically able to provide informed consent and undergo interviews will be approached for participation.\n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA - CONTROLS:\n\nPopulation-based controls will be frequency-matched to the cases by study center, race, age and sex, at the ratio of one control per case for non-African Americans and two controls per case for African Americans.\n\nControls aged 65 years and older will be identified from Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) files.\n\nControls under age 65 years will be identified from residents of the study areas by random telephone digit dialing (RDD).", "HealthyVolunteers": "No", "Gender": "All", "MinimumAge": "20 Years", "MaximumAge": "79 Years", "StdAgeList": {"StdAge": ["Adult", "Older Adult"]}, "StudyPopulation": "Cases and controls are residents of Chicago (Cook County), IL and Detroit (Wayne, Oakland, Macomb Counties), MI.", "SamplingMethod": "Probability Sample"}, "ContactsLocationsModule": {"OverallOfficialList": {"OverallOfficial": [{"OverallOfficialName": "Mark P Purdue, M.D.", "OverallOfficialAffiliation": "National Cancer Institute (NCI)", "OverallOfficialRole": "Principal Investigator"}]}, "LocationList": {"Location": [{"LocationFacility": "University of Illinois at Chicago", "LocationCity": "Chicago", "LocationState": "Illinois", "LocationZip": "60612", "LocationCountry": "United States"}, {"LocationFacility": "Wayne State University", "LocationCity": "Detroit", "LocationState": "Michigan", "LocationZip": "48201", "LocationCountry": "United States"}]}}, "ReferencesModule": {"ReferenceList": {"Reference": [{"ReferencePMID": "10471525", "ReferenceType": "background", "ReferenceCitation": "Bergstr\u00f6m A, Moradi T, Lindblad P, Nyr\u00e9n O, Adami HO, Wolk A.

pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), WHO Group IV Classification for Pulmonary Hypertension. The mission of the Registry will be to promote a greater understanding of the prevalence, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of patients with CTEPH through shared information, education, and collaborative investigation among pulmonary hypertension (PH) centers of excellence throughout the U.S.", "DetailedDescription": "Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a subset of pulmonary hypertension (PH) characterized by the obstruction of pulmonary arteries with fibrotic material and vascular remodeling that leads to increased pulmonary arterial pressure and right ventricular failure.\n\nA United States CTEPH Registry has been established under the guidance of a Steering Committee consisting of recognized physicians and scientists with expertise in CTEPH and related diseases. The mission of the Registry will be to promote a greater understanding of the prevalence, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of patients with CTEPH through shared information, education, and collaborative investigation among PH centers of excellence throughout the U.S. The development of a national CTEPH registry will be an important element in the advancement of the understanding of CTEPH and improvement in the care of patients who suffer from this debilitating disease.\n\nAll consecutive consenting patients recently diagnosed (< 6 months) with CTEPH at participating study sites will be enrolled. At the time of study entry, data on prior history and evaluation will be obtained from patient interview and review of medical records. Patients will be followed biannually after enrollment until the conclusion of the study (minimum of 1 year follow-up for final patients enrolled).\n\nMuch of the data gathered by the Registry will be presented as descriptive statistics. The Registry will seek the assistance of a biostatistician to develop a statistical plan for within patient and between patient cohort analyses.\n\nApproximately 750 patients with newly diagnosed (< 6 months) CTEPH will be enrolled.\n\nTIME FRAME:\n\nParticipants will be followed from the time of their enrollment until 1 year after the final patient is enrolled. Short term outcome measures and medical history will be collected during the initial visit, and clinical data will be collected from the initial clinic visits, hospital says, or procedures (if applicable). Patients will then be followed every 6 months after their enrollment for long term outcome measures on quality of life, functional status, and medical treatments.\n\nDATA ANALYSES:\n\nDemographics and Clinical Course:\n\nDemographics, risk factors, time to appropriate testing and diagnosis, PAH targeted medication use, functional status, and hemodynamics at the time of enrollment will be provided annually as aggregate data to all investigators.\n\nEvaluating Outcomes of PTE Surgery:\n\nDescriptive statistics of the peri-operative data collected will be provided as aggregate data to all investigators annually. Immediate post-operative and longitudinal follow-up of all patients undergoing PTE surgery will also be provided as aggregate data annually to all sites. Comparisons of hemodynamics, functional status, medication and supplemental oxygen use and healthcare utilization will be made between the pre-operative data and longitudinal post-operative data.\n\nEvaluating Predictors of Successful PTE:\n\nUsing longitudinal data collected on post-operative PTE patients, a definition of \"successful PTE\" will be established based upon hemodynamics, functional status and QoL. Retrospective analysis of pre-, peri-, and post-operative data can then be analyzed to identify factors that predict a \"successful\" or \"unsuccessful\" PTE surgery.\n\nEvaluating Outcomes of Nonsurgical Therapy of CTEPH:\n\nPredominantly descriptive statistics will be used to describe why patients are not operative candidates and the nonsurgical therapies (medication, balloon pulmonary angioplasty) used for treatment. Changes in hemodynamics, functional status, QoL and healthcare utilization on therapy will be provided as aggregate data annually.\n\nEvolving Research Needs:\n\nTo adapt to the evolving science and research needs of the CTEPH community, separate analysis plans will be developed for new objectives identified and minor changes in the eCRF may occur in response to new diagnostics and treatments, if approved by the Steering Committee. Ongoing assessment of enrollment and data captured will also be performed by the Steering Committee to be certain the goals of the Registry are being met.\n\nCOMMITTEES:\n\nA Steering Committee, chaired by Dr. Kim Kerr, is comprised of thought leaders in the areas of cardiology, pulmonology, and cardiothoracic surgery with expertise in CTEPH. The committee will have the following responsibilities:\n\nProvide advice and guidance on the U.S. CTEPH Registry study design and protocol\nProvide advice and guidance on the variables to be captured by the eCRF\nProvide guidance on study sites selection\nReview data results and provide insights into interpretation of the data annually\nProvide input on the planning and organization of abstracts and manuscripts\nReview abstracts and papers for submission to scientific journals or conferences\nPresent data at conferences\n\nAn Adjudication Committee, consisting of physicians with expertise in the diagnosis of CTEPH, will review all patients felt by Investigators to be eligible for the Registry.

Although Medicare compares the rates of rehospitalization across the country, we have found no comparison of different countries. This is a first attempt to compare rehospitalization in the US with France where national health insurance (NHI) provides easy access to primary care but, like the US, policymakers struggle to improve coordination between hospitals and community-based health care providers.Although France's NHI system with central state intervention differs from the United States' tradition of federalism, private health insurance and pluralism, policymakers seek to achieve cost savings and to reform the health care system. A recent literature review on avoidable rehospitalization of older persons in France cited studies on the topic and relied largely on ones from the US. Starting in 2013, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) 'Hospitals Readmissions Reductions Program' withheld up to 1% of regular reimbursements for hospitals with higher than expected (by CMS) rates of rehospitalization, within 30 days of discharge, due to heart attacks, heart failure and pneumonia. CMS increased this to 2% in 2014, will raise it to 3% in 2015 and may subsequently expand the list of conditions for which it will penalize early rehospitalizations. Policymakers in France have been reluctant to implement a hospital pay for performance system based on a rehospitalization indicator whose validity is a subject of considerable controversy. Despite the controversy and differences in approach, a comparison of rehospitalizations between the US and France provides a cross-national perspective on a timely policy issue facing both countries.", "DetailedDescription": "Data sources :\n\nThe hospital administrative data for this study are from the SNIIRAM (Syste'me National d'Informations Inter Regimes de l'Assurance Maladie) which also includes the national hospital reporting system (PMSI - Programme de Medicalisation des Systemes d'Information. The SNIIRAM is a centralized administrative database of all health services reimbursed under France's NHI program. The PMSI, based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), is a centralized administrative database of hospital discharge records by diagnosis, procedure, age and residence of patients from all hospitals in France. It is managed by a national agency (ATIH).\n\nTo calculate the proportion of rehospitalized patients (65\u00fe) who received outpatient visits (all physician consultations in community-based practice, as well as hospital outpatient visits) between the time of discharge and rehospitalization, we collaborated with analysts at the French NHI fund (CNAMTS). We linked the individual identifying variable for rehospitalized patients and extracted the outpatient visits from the SNIIRAM database for all medical and surgical admissions.

Tinnitus can be very debilitating as many aspects of daily life can be affected, such as sleep, mood, and concentration. Currently, there is no cure for tinnitus. Pharmacological or sound-therapy based interventions are sometimes provided, but may be of limited value to certain individuals. Research suggests that Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) based approaches have the most evidence of effectiveness in the management of tinnitus. However, CBT is rarely offered in the U.S. (less than 1%), partly attributed to a lack of trained professionals who can deliver CBT. To improve access to CBT for tinnitus, and online CBT program has been developed. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a CBT Internet-based intervention for adults with tinnitus in the United States.", "DetailedDescription": "Objective: This study aims to determine the feasibility and efficacy of an Internet-based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) in reducing the impact associated with tinnitus in the United States.\n\nHypothesis: It is hypothesized that ICBT will result in reduced tinnitus-related distress, decreased sleep disturbance, decreased anxiety and depression, and improved health-related quality of life in a treatment group as compared with adults in the weekly check-in control-group in the U.S. population. The investigators also hypothesize that these results will be stable in both short- and long-term post-intervention.\n\nDesign: A two-armed Randomized Control Trial (RCT), with a one-year follow-up design will be used to evaluate the efficacy of ICBT on tinnitus distress.\n\nSetting: This will be an Internet-based study for adults with tinnitus living in the State of Texas, USA.\n\nParticipants: Eligible participants will include adults with tinnitus for a minimum period of 3 months with internet access and no major medical or psychiatric conditions. 80 participants will be recruited for each group and will be randomly assigned using a computer-generated randomization schedule by an independent research assistant after being pre-stratified for language and tinnitus severity.\n\nIntervention: The intervention offered is a guided CTB-based internet intervention (ICBT), providing an opportunity to learn about new ways of coping with tinnitus during everyday life. It is 8-week long e-learning intervention, with new modules introduced weekly and assignments are given to practice techniques learned.\n\nOutcome measures: The main outcome measure is the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI).

The current databases do not include multiple data points, or follow-up data, or a section for specific adverse events to be documented. Moreover, until now, there has been no approved devices for PDA closure in children < 2kg. This clinical study is the first of its kind to collect data from all transcatheter device closure of PDA in children < 2kg performed in the USA.This study will be limited to children between 700 to 2000 grams who are the most vulnerable population undergoing this procedure. This will allow us to understand the real world experience (efficacy and safety) of using the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder and other devices in an extremely vulnerable, yet highly underserved population. The study will allow for standardization of this procedure throughout the country for the small children (<2 kg) with a PDA. This is a multi-center, single arm, observational data collection study. This will be a large population study to help analyze outcomes in subjects <2 kg. The trial has two primary endpoints for safety and effectiveness without formal hypothesis.

Providence St. Vincent Medical Center includes strict control of blood sugar (glucose) levels for 3 days after surgery. This is done through frequent monitoring of blood sugar levels and by giving insulin continuously through a needle into a vein (intravenously). This intensive glucose control has resulted in fewer complications such as serious infections and death, and has shortened the length of the hospital stay for patients.\n\nThis study treatment is different from standard treatment in that it extends the intensive glucose control beyond the third postoperative day to one full year. Once discharged from the hospital following the CABG procedure, the intense glucose control is done using subcutaneous insulin (a shot under the skin), oral medications, and by measuring blood sugar levels frequently.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to see how safe and effective strict glucose control is when extended beyond 3 days and hospital discharge for one year. Another purpose is to see how well patients can comply with the daily management of intensive glucose control for one-year as well as the study follow-up schedule.", "DetailedDescription": "Purpose Pilot study to gather information for \"United States CABG Diabetes Project\" (USCDP) Multi-center Randomized Trial.\n\nFor 14 years our research team has successfully implemented an increasingly aggressive series of intravenous insulin protocols that normalize blood glucose levels for 3 postoperative days in patients with diabetes who undergo cardiac surgery. This has resulted in significant reductions in mortality, infection and length of stay (LOS) and has normalized those outcomes to those of the population without diabetes (DM). The current protocol ends on the morning of the 3rd postoperative day.\n\nWe believe that a logical expansion of this groundbreaking work is to extend the duration of intensive glycemic control beyond the third postoperative day and into the outpatient period. However it would be impossible to do so with the continued use of CII therapy. Therefore, we propose to employ intensive subcutaneous insulin therapies and oral hypoglycemic agents to affect continued tight glycemic control following discontinuation of CII and continue such therapy beyond hospital discharge for a period of at least one year.\n\nWe hypothesize that this will lead to further reductions in major adverse cardiac outcomes in the high-risk diabetes coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) subgroup. The optimal method to test this hypothesis is with a very large, multi-center clinical trial. However, before embarking on such a resource-consuming endeavor, we intend to test the concepts, methods, implementation strategies, patient acceptability and compliance, proposed biomarkers and clinical outcomes of such a trial with this proposed limited pilot study.\n\nIf the information obtained from this pilot study is favorable, we will submit for full funding of the multicenter USCDP clinical trial to the NIDDK and NHLBI divisions of the NIH.

primarily affects young men. It is the most common cancer among U.S. males ages 25-34. The only well-described risk factors are cryptorchism (undescended testis), family history of TGCT, and personal history of TGCT. To better understand the environmental and genetic determinants of TGCT risk, a case-control study will be conducted among members of the U.S. armed forces. The study will include men who have donated a blood sample to the Department of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR) between 1989 and 2000. All DoDSR donors who have developed GCT will be matched to DoDSR donors who have not developed TGCT. Approximately 1,080 men with TGCT, 1,080 controls, and 2,160 mothers will be included in the study.\n\nThe DoDSR serum sample will be tested for organochlorines levels, gonadotropin levels, and viral antibody titres. Each participant will donate a saliva specimen that will be used in an examination of genetic susceptibility. Each participant will also complete a questionnaire concerning a variety of possible risk factors such as physical activity, medical history, medication history, and other risk factors. The mothers of all participants will be invited to participate by completing a questionnaire concerning perinatal exposures and events and by donating a saliva sample.\n\nThe three main objectives of this study are to:\n\ndetermine whether environmental endocrine modulators (i.e., chlorinated pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls) are related to risk of GCT and, if so, whether their effects are augmented by other risk factors.\ndetermine whether genetic susceptibility to GCT exists and to characterize the environmental risk factors related to that susceptibility.\ndetermine whether there are distinct causes of GCT by relating the tissue structures of the tumors to the risk factors.", "DetailedDescription": "The incidence of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) has increased during the better part of the twentieth century and is of particular concern as it primarily affects young men. Though the tumor is relatively infrequent in the population as a whole, TGCT is the most common cancer among U.S. males in the age group 15-34 years. Despite the increases in TGCT rates, the etiology is still poorly understood. The only well described risk factors for TGCT are cryptorchism, family history of TGCT and personal history of TGCT. Therefore, in order to understand better the environmental and genetic determinants of TGCT risk, a case-control study will be conducted among members of the U.S. Armed Forces. The study will include men who have donated a blood sample to the Department of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR) between the years 1989 and 2003. All DoDSR donors who have developed GCT will be matched to DoDSR donors who have not developed TGCT.\n\nA total of 1682 servicemen were enrolled in the study; 754 cases and 928 controls. Of these participants, 1303 men (77%, 590 cases, 713 controls) donated buccal cell samples. In addition to the servicemen, a total of 1090 mothers of servicemen were enrolled and 952 (87%) provided a buccal specimen. The DoDSR serum samples have been assayed for levels of organochlorines pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl congeners, insulin-like growth factors and gonadotropins and steroid hormones. DNA isolated from the buccal cell specimens have thus far been genotyped for polymorphysms in the hormone metabolism and immune function pathway, immune function pathway, insulin-like growth factor pathway and for single nucleotide polymorphisms in the 8q24 locus. In addition, a genome-wide association study has completed.

opinions of a messaging campaign.\n\nParticipants: Participants will be recruited through Prime Panels and will be US-based adults (18 years old and older) who consumed red meat in the past 30 days.\n\nProcedures (methods): After completing a screening question about meat consumption, participants will review a consent form. If they select to participate in the study, participants will be randomly assigned to view control messages, red meat-related environment messages, or red meat-related health messages. They will be asked a series of questions about these messages.\n\nParticipants will also be asked about grocery shopping preferences and standard demographics questions.", "DetailedDescription": "Excess consumption of red and processed meat is a growing problem, especially in the United States where meat is consumed more than three times the global average. Epidemiological evidence for the association between excess meat intake and negative health outcomes (such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes) as well as negative environmental impacts (such as pollution, overuse of resources, and carbon emissions) indicates that reducing meat consumption should be particularly pertinent to researchers and other public health professionals.\n\nThe potential of using widespread communication campaigns, such as Meatless Monday, to reduce meat consumption by educating individuals on the associated health and environmental risks appears to be promising. However, the current literature is missing information regarding what types of messages are most effective (e.g. negative environmental messages vs. negative health messages). To address this knowledge gap, our study will collect quantitative data in measurable outcomes to understand effectiveness and comprehension of environmental messages and health messages to reduce meat consumption.\n\nSetting: This is an online study using Qualtrics, so this research does not involve talking to human participants.\n\nRecruitment: Participants will be recruited through Prime Panels, a survey research firm through which participants voluntarily sign up to participate in research studies.\n\nInformed Consent: Participants will read a written consent document that includes information about the study's purpose, expectations, and possible risks and benefits. Participants will acknowledge that they have read and agreed to the terms by clicking forward.\n\nRandomization: Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) control (about checking their credit score), 2) environment-focused Meatless Monday messages, or 3) health-focused Meatless Monday messages.\n\nAssessment: Using an online platform (Qualtrics), participants will answer a screening question about red meat consumption. If they are eligible (consumption of red meat 1 time per week or more), they will proceed to the main study after reading and agreeing to the written consent form. Participants will then answer two questions about their belief in climate change. Participants will then view four messages in their ascribed conditions. After viewing all 4 messages, participants will answer a series of questions about the messages they viewed. Then, participants will answer a series of demographic questions. Participants will also answer questions about grocery shopping preferences.\n\nDetailed description of the trial arms: This study is a three-armed between subjects' design. Participants will be randomized to view a set of four messages either about the environmental harms of meat production (intervention), the health harms of meat consumption (intervention), or about checking their credit score (control).

Together, these efforts can improve access to naloxone for people at high risk of overdose, thereby improving our nation's response to the opioid overdose epidemic.", "DetailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to understand and improve naloxone implementation within Syringe Service Programs (SSPs) to reduce opioid overdose mortality in the United States. To achieve this goal, we will implement an external facilitation intervention that has been shown to improve implementation in HIV service settings. The intervention will leverage a naloxone implementation expert who will work with SSP organizational directors to identify barriers to and facilitators of achieving naloxone implementation quality and maximizing reach. We propose to assess the effectiveness of external facilitation, compared to dissemination of an implementation manual, in a national sample of SSPs in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Our proposed specific aims are as follows:\n\nAim 1: To characterize United States syringe service programs along the exploration, preparation, implementation and sustainment (EPIS) continuum for delivering naloxone.\n\nAim 2: To test the effectiveness of external facilitation + dissemination of the naloxone implementation manual, compared with dissemination of the naloxone implementation manual alone, to improve the advancement of naloxone along the EPIS continuum among United States syringe service programs.\n\nHypothesis. The dissemination and external facilitation arm will be more effective in advancing naloxone implementation along the EPIS continuum between baseline and 12-month follow-up, than the dissemination-only arm.\n\nTo achieve these aims, 425 SSPs that are registered with the North American Syringe Exchange Network (NASEN) and /or receive information from harm reduction related web-based forums (e.g., online discussion groups, newsletters and listservs)will be asked to participate in an on-line cross-sectional survey and will be sent a hyperlink to the initial screening survey. We will use the on-line survey results to characterize the SSPs along the exploration, preparation, implementation and sustainment (EPIS) continuum for delivering the naloxone intervention (AIM 1).\n\nThe on-line survey includes a set of questions designed to collect information to evaluate where the SSP falls along the EPIS continuum for naloxone delivery. SSPs in the Implementation (I) phase of the EPIS continuum (estimated n = 100) will be contacted by research staff and offered the opportunity to participate in the RCT. SSPs that are interested in participating in the RCT will be enrolled in the study. For those SSPs who agree to participate, study staff will confirm eligibility by reviewing and documenting responses to the screening survey.\n\nFollowing informed consent procedures, the study staff will administer the baseline survey to the SSP representative. The baseline survey will include questions about programmatic capacity, organizational culture, potential for internal champion or leader, perceived need for naloxone distribution within their community, and community acceptance of peer naloxone distribution programming. The study staff will then randomize SSPs into one of the one of the two study arms: (1) dissemination of the implementation manual and external facilitation for 12 months (experimental arm; n=50) and (2) dissemination of the implementation manual only (control arm; n=50).\n\nAll SSPs enrolled in the RCT will be sent a copy of the naloxone implementation manual either via email, hyperlink or the U.S. postal service depending on the preference of the participant. Those SSPs in the experimental arm will be enrolled in the EF intervention during which they will work directly with an OC to advance naloxone delivery as far along the EPIS continuum as possible during a 12-month period. The intervention will be delivered via phone calls, web-enabled audio and screen-sharing technology, and site visits. The key activities of the EF intervention include, initial SSP engagement, knowledge enhancement, capacity assessment, information gathering, identification of barriers and facilitators, development of action plans and provision of feedback, identification of funding and linkage to resources, and training of SSP staff.\n\nAt the end of the 12-month intervention period, SSPs in both study arms will participate in a follow-up survey, conducted by study staff, to evaluate advancement of naloxone implementation along the EPIS continuum."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition": ["Opioid Overdose"]}, "KeywordList": {"Keyword": ["Opioid Overdose Prevention", "Naloxone Implementation", "Implementation Science"]}}, "DesignModule": {"StudyType": "Interventional", "PhaseList": {"Phase": ["Not Applicable"]}, "DesignInfo": {"DesignAllocation": "Randomized", "DesignInterventionModel": "Parallel Assignment", "DesignPrimaryPurpose": "Prevention", "DesignMaskingInfo": {"DesignMasking": "None (Open Label)"}}, "EnrollmentInfo": {"EnrollmentCount": "100", "EnrollmentType": "Anticipated"}}, "ArmsInterventionsModule": {"ArmGroupList": {"ArmGroup": [{"ArmGroupLabel": "Implementation Manual and External Facilitation", "ArmGroupType": "Experimental", "ArmGroupDescription": "This arm will receive the naloxone intervention implementation manual and the External Facilitation (EF) intervention.

People can get malaria if a mosquito that carries the parasite bites them. Malaria infection does not happen in the United States, but many people in Africa, Asia, and South America are at risk for it. Researchers want to test two vaccines that may help decrease malaria infection.\n\nObjective:\n\n- To see if two vaccines (Pfs25M-EPA/Alhydrogel and Pfs230DIM-EPA/Alhydrogel ) are safe in humans and cause an immune response that will prevent malaria parasites from correctly growing in the mosquito.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Healthy adults ages 18 50.\n\nDesign:\n\nThere are several groups in this study. Each group will receive a different dose of the vaccine and some groups will received both vaccines.\nVaccinations will be given on two days about 4 weeks apart.\nParticipants will receive each vaccine as an injection into the arm. Blood will be drawn on the day of vaccination.\nIn the 4 weeks after receiving a vaccination, participants will have at least 3 clinic visits and 1 phone contact. They will have at least 3 more visits and 3 phone contacts over the next 6 months.\nAt each visit, participants will be evaluated for side effects to the vaccine and any new health changes or problems. They will be asked how they are feeling and if they have taken any medicine. Blood and urine samples may be taken at the visit. More follow-up visits may be needed to follow up on changes or problems.", "DetailedDescription": "A vaccine to interrupt malaria transmission would be a valuable tool for local elimination or\n\neradication of this disease. Pfs25 and Pfs230, surface antigens of zygotes and ookinetes in the mosquito stage of Plasmodium falciparum, are the lead candidates for a malaria transmission blocking vaccine. Recombinant Pfs25M and recombinant Pfs230D1M have each been conjugated to Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoProtein A (EPA) and adjuvanted with Alhydrogel . This dose-escalating phase 1 study will determine safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines in US adults and subsequently in Malian adults.\n\nA total of 260 subjects will be enrolled at sites in the US and Mali to receive escalating doses of Pfs25M- EPA/Alhydrogel , Pfs230D1M-EPA/Alhydrogel , or simultaneous Pfs25MEPA/Alhydrogel and Pfs230D1M-EPA/Alhydrogel . Enrollment within each group will be staggered for additional safety, and subjects will only be enrolled into the simultaneous administration group once each individual dose has been administered and reviewed for safety. Subjects will be followed for at least 6 months after the last vaccination. Safety outcomes will be local and systemic adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Immunogenicity outcomes will be antibody responses as measured by ELISA against recombinant Pfs25, Pfs230, and EPA, and B cell responses. Functional activity of the induced antibodies will be assessed by membrane feeding assays conducted at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition": ["Malaria"]}, "KeywordList": {"Keyword": ["Assays", "Antibody", "Reactogenicity", "Mosquito", "Responses"]}}, "DesignModule": {"StudyType": "Interventional", "PhaseList": {"Phase": ["Phase 1"]}, "DesignInfo": {"DesignAllocation": "Randomized", "DesignInterventionModel": "Parallel Assignment", "DesignPrimaryPurpose": "Prevention", "DesignMaskingInfo": {"DesignMasking": "Double", "DesignWhoMaskedList": {"DesignWhoMasked": ["Participant", "Investigator"]}}}, "EnrollmentInfo": {"EnrollmentCount": "538", "EnrollmentType": "Actual"}}, "ArmsInterventionsModule": {"ArmGroupList": {"ArmGroup": [{"ArmGroupLabel": "Group 1- Mali", "ArmGroupType": "Experimental", "ArmGroupDescription": "Arm A1 (N=5) to receive 16 micrograms Pfs25M on D0, D28 Arm A2 (N=50) to receive 47 micrograms Pfs25M and Normal Saline on D0, D28, D168, D530", "ArmGroupInterventionList": {"ArmGroupInterventionName": ["Biological: Pfs25M-EPA/Alhydrogel"]}}, {"ArmGroupLabel": "Group 1-U.S", "ArmGroupType": "Experimental", "ArmGroupDescription": "Arm 1a (N=5) to receive 16 micrograms Pfs25M on D0, D28.

Moving the LINQ\u2122 insertion procedure to the office setting is not expected to decrease the complication rate compared to in hospital insertion procedures, however, moving the LINQ\u2122 insertion procedure out of the traditional hospital setting may benefit the patient and reduce the burden to the healthcare system."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition": ["Arrhythmia"]}}, "DesignModule": {"StudyType": "Interventional", "PhaseList": {"Phase": ["Not Applicable"]}, "DesignInfo": {"DesignAllocation": "Randomized", "DesignInterventionModel": "Parallel Assignment", "DesignPrimaryPurpose": "Health Services Research", "DesignMaskingInfo": {"DesignMasking": "None (Open Label)", "DesignMaskingDescription": "The site of the Reveal LINQ insertion was randomized.

{"BriefSummary": "This proof-of-concept randomized trial evaluates the effectiveness of using an online decision aid (US-ANSWER-2) in the decision-making to start or switch biologic therapy in US patients with rheumatoid arthritis.", "DetailedDescription": "The proposed project aims to improve the process of making evidence-informed treatment decisions by patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ultimately empower patient self-management. Current RA treatment emphasizes: 1) the need for early and aggressive treatment, and 2) the use of a treat-to-target approach. However, patients often struggle with treatment decisions, especially when the options have both benefits and risks. To address this challenge, investigators based at Arthritis Research Canada have previously developed an online decision aid called ANSWER-2 (ANimated, Self-serve, WEb-based, Research Tool: Version 2) for RA patients who are considering a biologic, and this tool has been recently adapted for the US healthcare setting (called US-ANSWER-2).\n\nObjectives: 1) To evaluate the effectiveness of US-ANSWER-2 in reducing patients' decisional conflict. 2) To assess the extent to which US-ANSWER-2 improves patients' knowledge about RA medications and confidence in managing their health. 3) To examine the experiences of patients and rheumatologists in using US-ANSWER-2.\n\nThe investigators will conduct a proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial with 80 patients with RA. Eligible individuals are those: 1) with a diagnosis of RA from a rheumatologist, 2) whose rheumatologists have recommended initiating a biologic or switching to another biologic, and 3) who have internet access and email. The Intervention Group will receive simple instructions to access the US-ANSWER-2 decision aid and complete the program on their own within two days. At the end of the session, a one-page summary will be produced to help them discuss their questions, concerns, and preferred choices with their health care providers. The Control Group will receive a standard online medication guide, reflective of usual practice. Participants will complete the Decisional Conflict Scale (primary outcome) before and after the intervention (US-ANSWER-2 or standard online medication guide). The following secondary outcome measures will be collected at baseline, Month 1, and Month 2: 1) Medication Education Impact Questionnaire, and 2) Partners in Health Scale. In addition, the use of healthcare resources will be collected at baseline and Month 2, and the use of biologics will be collected at Month 6. All participants and their rheumatologists will be invited to participate in a qualitative interview about their experience with the patient decision aid."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition": ["Rheumatoid Arthritis"]}, "KeywordList": {"Keyword": ["Rheumatoid Arthritis", "Decision Aids", "Biologics"]}}, "DesignModule": {"StudyType": "Interventional", "PhaseList": {"Phase": ["Not Applicable"]}, "DesignInfo": {"DesignAllocation": "Randomized", "DesignInterventionModel": "Parallel Assignment", "DesignPrimaryPurpose": "Supportive Care", "DesignMaskingInfo": {"DesignMasking": "Single", "DesignWhoMaskedList": {"DesignWhoMasked": ["Outcomes Assessor"]}}}, "EnrollmentInfo": {"EnrollmentCount": "80", "EnrollmentType": "Anticipated"}}, "ArmsInterventionsModule": {"ArmGroupList": {"ArmGroup": [{"ArmGroupLabel": "US-ANSWER-2 decision aid", "ArmGroupType": "Experimental", "ArmGroupDescription": "The intervention group will receive simple instructions to access the US-ANSWER-2 decision aid and complete the program on their own computers within two days.

enrolling 100 healthcare Provider volunteers (n=100) from across the United States to help to evaluate and document the financial impact of COVID-19 on Physicians and other healthcare Providers. This investigation will compare individual Physician revenues before and after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigators expect to be able to differentiate between revenues lost due to the COVID-19-driven business recession and revenues lost due to the manipulation of reimbursement processes by insurance companies. The inextricable linkage between Payer and Physician revenues suggests that Payer revenues are higher at the direct expense of Physicians, since both streams come from the same sources of funding. The secondary objective is aimed at revealing the methods Payers use to retain more money.", "DetailedDescription": "Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, 2020, Physicians and other medical Providers have taken devastating hits to their practice revenues. Most of the losses are due to doctors being forced to curtail elective procedures and office visits as Americans were ordered to stay home during the height of the national health emergency.\n\nAs Physicians were able to return to work in the early Summer, even if only partially, many had to adjust to the newer medical practice of telehealth, and the lower revenues that came with it. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) gave assurances to Physicians that Medicare would reimburse telehealth encounters at 100% of the office visit rate. But private Payers were under no such obligation. Across the country, Physicians are reporting that they're being reimbursed at about 70% of an office visit rate despite the fact that telehealth requires both resources and expertise to implement effectively, and each encounter takes up to twice as long as an office visit.\n\nAdding to financial hardships, Physicians across the nation are reporting that legitimate insurance claims are being held up and denied by the insurance companies at a higher rate than ever, cutting off the cash that they need so desperately. As of June 1, only half of Physician practices say they have enough cash to stay open for another month.\n\nIn just 2 months in the spring of 2020, over 45 million Americans lost their jobs and for many, that also meant the loss of their employment-related health insurance. Despite shedding a massive number of members from their rolls, health insurance companies are actually predicting record profits for 2020. The pandemic it seems, is very good indeed for the health insurance business. Private investors and executives are taking huge dividends and bonuses out of the system just at a time when US healthcare needs a vast new investment of healthcare resources into the system. The good fortune of a few individuals and corporations comes at an as yet untold expense to American society.\n\nThe formula for insurance company success in a pandemic only happens one way. By keeping member premiums, delaying payments, and denying treatment authorizations, the large health insurance companies are taking advantage of the profound misfortunes of both doctors and patients during a national health emergency.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic will have adverse effects on the health of Americans that will be sprawling and long-felt. However, it is not for this study to decide whether private interests will always be antithetical to public interests when it comes to healthcare. That is a public debate that will continue to evolve as the profound weaknesses of the American way of distributing healthcare are magnified and exposed in a time of social upheaval.\n\nThe investigators do know that in order to get a handle on the major damage we see occurring in real-time- and to inform that debate, it is first necessary to measure it."}, "ConditionsModule":

Clostridium has been isolated from the vagina in 4-18% of normal, health non-pregnant women, with Clostridium perfringens the most common isolate. Most studies do not differentiate the small percentage of other clostridia present in the vaginal microenvironment. The vaginal carriage rate for Clostridium sordellii remains unknown, but is probably very low, less than 1%.\n\nThe correlates of clostridial carriage are unknown, and data on the etiology and lethality of clostridial infection among women of reproductive age are insufficient to guide possible courses of safe and effective prevention.

If it is safe, then 20 volunteers will get 50 \u00b5g FMP010 in AS01B. Vaccinations are given IM in the deltoid of the non-dominant arm, every month for 3 months. After each vaccination, the subjects will follow up at clinical trials for evaluation of any adverse events. There will be blood draws to assess safety of the vaccine as well as the level of immune response generated to the vaccine.\n\nUpon receipt of preliminary safety results, the Kenya phase begins in which 30 volunteers who are randomized to receive either 50 \u00b5g FMP010 in AS01B (20) or the rabies vaccine (10).

Participants randomized to the adapted CETA arm will initiate CETA with the trained counselor. The number of CETA sessions will depend on the patient's presentation but will range from 7-13 weekly in-person 1-hour sessions.Before randomization, enrolled participants will complete a baseline assessment including sociodemographic information; self-reported health; standardized assessments of depressive, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms and substance use; and key related structural and psychosocial factors including housing stability,intimate partner violence (IPV), other violence in the home, coping, social support, and experiences of stigma related to mental health.\n\nParticipants in the Enhanced Contact arm will complete a follow-up research assessment at 3 months post baseline.Participants in the adapted CETA arm will complete this assessment after the final CETA session,also expected to be at approximately 3 months post-baseline.

study is to define the metabolic characteristics of individuals with Lean Diabetes. We aim to determine whether differences in body composition, including any differences in lipid (fat) deposition, exist compared to individuals with either known forms of diabetes (eg, type 1 and type 2), or individuals without diabetes. Diabetes affects the ability of the body to process glucose (sugar). Therefore, we also plan to investigate the ability of the hormone insulin to regulate changes in glucose in these individuals. Developing a greater understanding of the features of this condition could have tremendous therapeutic benefit for these individuals.", "DetailedDescription": "India has the world's highest prevalence of diabetes, expected to rise to 80 million by 2030. This includes many patients with Lean Diabetes, which is a form of diabetes identified clinically by early onset, high insulin requirements, absence of other pancreatic disease, and low body mass index (typically \u226417 kg/m2) at presentation. Despite its prevalence, Lean Diabetes remains a relatively unknown disease that stirs conflicting opinions regarding its classification, diagnostic criteria, and pathogenesis.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will study individuals meeting the criteria for Lean Diabetes, Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and patients without diabetes using a procedure called a \"pancreatic clamp\" study. During the clamp procedure, glucose (a sugar) and insulin (a hormone produced in the pancreas that regulates the amount of glucose in the blood) are infused with an intravenous catheter, and blood samples are collected periodically throughout the procedure to measure blood sugar levels and the levels of several hormones that are found in the body and are related to glucose metabolism. Endogenous glucose production (a measure of the body's production of sugar) will also be measured. Participants will also have a fat biopsy, and will be given a mixed meal challenge which is a test that detects hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance.\n\nThe overall goal of this study is to define the metabolic characteristics of individuals with Lean Diabetes and to determine which differences exist compared to individuals with other known forms of diabetes or individuals without diabetes."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition": ["Malnutrition; Diabetes", "Diabetes"]}, "KeywordList": {"Keyword": ["Diabetes", "Malnutrition"]}}, "DesignModule": {"StudyType": "Observational", "PatientRegistry": "No", "DesignInfo": {"DesignObservationalModelList": {"DesignObservationalModel": ["Case-Control"]}, "DesignTimePerspectiveList": {"DesignTimePerspective": ["Prospective"]}}, "BioSpec": {"BioSpecRetention": "Samples Without DNA", "BioSpecDescription": "Plasma, Fat Biopsy"}, "EnrollmentInfo": {"EnrollmentCount": "80", "EnrollmentType": "Anticipated"}}, "ArmsInterventionsModule": {"ArmGroupList": {"ArmGroup": [{"ArmGroupLabel": "Lean Diabetes Subjects", "ArmGroupDescription": "N=20 subjects with BMI 16-22.5 kg/m2, with a history of low birth weight and malnutrition documented on at least one occasion.

Given the lack of prior research in this area in the Air Force and the broad number of topics of interest, the aims of the study are predominantly exploratory and results may be hypothesis generating.\n\nThe MilSeq Project will be conducted in two sequential phases. Phase I of the study will recruit, consent, and enroll approximately 750 ostensibly healthy active-duty Airmen who receive medical care in military Primary Care, Internal Medicine, and/or Family Practice settings to take a baseline survey. This survey will be administered to explore active-duty Airmen's perceptions of and preferences for GS, identify motivations and barriers to active-duty Airmen participating in a WES study, and assess interest in taking part in the WES study.\n\nPhase II of the study will recruit, consent, and enroll 75 ostensibly healthy active-duty Airmen who receive medical care in military Primary Care, Internal Medicine and/or Family Practice settings who in their baseline survey expressed interest in receiving WES through a research study. WES will be performed on each enrolled patient-participant. The result will be disclosed by an HCP-participant and permanently integrated into the patient-participant's EMR. Phase II will also recruit 10-20 military Primary Care, Internal Medicine, and/or Family Practice HCPs and consent them to participate in the study. The HCPs will receive an educational primer in genomics and will disclose WES results to Airmen participants.\n\nThere are a number of potential benefits and challenges to incorporating genomic medicine into the military, some that are relevant to the broader civilian community, but some that are unique to this population. Some of these challenges include: (a) how GS may or may not affect the perception of fitness for duty; (b) how genomic discrimination may or may not occur in the military setting; (c) how to best deal with unanticipated findings; and (d) how genomic results can be practically integrated into a military setting.

This study will provide a contemporary description of the epidemiology and medical management of United States adults with severe asthma who have not achieved control with high-dose ICS therapy and additional controllers. Additionally, the study will describe the use of and outcomes associated with recently approved monoclonal antibody therapies for severe asthma. Patients will be enrolled from a diverse population of academic and community-based specialist centers across the US. Data will be collected in a naturalistic manner and patient management will not be influenced by the study protocol. At least 1500 patients in the US with a confirmed diagnosis of severe asthma will be enrolled by a diverse set of asthma specialists (eg, allergists and pulmonologists who treat asthma) from academic and community-based centers. Basic de-identified information will be collected for all patients meeting study inclusion criteria, including those not approached for enrollment or who decline enrollment, to enable an assessment of the enrolled and non-enrolled populations. This information will include age, sex, insurance status, age at asthma diagnosis, class of asthma treatment per study inclusion criteria, number of asthma exacerbations in the past 12 months, study eligibility, whether the patient was approached for enrollment, study enrollment status, and reason for not enrolling for those who are approached but do not enroll. Patient-reported asthma control (Asthma Control Test [ACT]), asthma exacerbations, and treatment adherence will be solicited monthly. Patient-reported information on asthma-related healthcare utilization, global evaluation of treatment effectiveness (GETE), and work productivity (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Asthma questionnaire [WPAI-Asthma]) will be collected at baseline and approximately every 3 months. Detailed information on asthma-related quality of life (Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]) as well as presence of an asthma treatment plan will be collected from patients approximately every 6 months. All of the questionnaires will be collected via web-based surveys. Patients will then be followed until study discontinuation or the patient withdraws from the study or death, whichever occurs first.

The closed suction drainage system is widely used in proximal femur surgeries. Recently, the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) system was advocated for treating intertrochanteric fractures (ITFs) in the elderly patients. However, the true effect of the closed suction drainage system with PFNA fixation on outcomes in ITFs is still unknown. This prospective randomized controlled trial aimed to examine whether routine drainage is useful for PFNA fixation in ITFs.\n\nMethods: A total of 80 patients with acute ITFs were treated with closed or mini-open reduction with PFNA fixation at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital and 60 eligible patients (22 men and 38 women) were randomized for whether to receive suction drainage. In clinical outcomes, the visual analog scale (VAS), morphine equivalent dosage, injured thigh width, body temperature, and wound condition with specific reference to hematoma formation and wound infection were measured on postoperative days 1, 2, 4, and 10. In laboratory outcomes, the investigators evaluated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels postoperatively at different time points. Blood transfusion and total blood loss (TBL) were measured by Mercuriali's formula in millimeter.", "DetailedDescription": "Participants This study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Cheng Kung University Hospital (IRB: B-BR-107-046-T). This single center study was performed between May 2018 and April 2019. All the 60 patients who were treated with a PFNA system (Depuy Synthes\u00ae, Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (II), Solothurn, Switzerland) were consecutively included. Patients were included in the study if they (1) had an acute (injury less than 2 weeks) proximal femoral fracture, classified as Arbeitsgemeinschaft f\u00fcr Osteosynthesefragen (AO) 31A1, 31A2, and 31A3, (2) were treated with closed reduction or mini-open reduction, and (3) were followed-up for at least 2 weeks post-surgery. Patients were excluded from the study if they had (1) a history of muscular-skeletal disorder or inflammatory arthritis, (2) other combined injury, (3) a previous hip surgery, (4) an extensive open reduction of fracture site, (5) hemodynamic instability, (6) consumed non-steroid inflammatory drug, steroid, or morphine before treatment, and (7) abnormal preoperative laboratory data, especially anticoagulation data, including prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and platelet level. The investigators established a table of random numbers, which was readily generated by computer 15, and divided participants into the drained and undrained groups based on their arrival time to the investigator's hospital.\n\nSurgery procedure\n\nExperienced trauma surgeons performed all the procedures. General or spinal anesthesia was determined by anesthesiologist. All patients received a single dose of 1 g cefazolin as preoperative prophylactic antibiotic. All the operations were performed on a traction table in supine position under fluoroscopic guidance. Reduction was achieved with closed reduction or mini-open reduction, including percutaneous Kapandji procedure or a minimally invasive procedure using the cerclage wire passer (Cerclage passer, DePuy Synthes, Solothurn, Switzerland). The reduction was regarded acceptable if no significant varus malalignment of the proximal fragment (neck-shaft angle more than 15\u00b0) existed or if less than 10 mm of translation existed between the main fragments as described previously. After achieving reduction, the skin was incised 3-5 cm proximal to the tip of the greater trochanter followed by straight longitudinal incision in the fascia of the gluteus muscle. The gluteus maximus muscle was split using the blunt dissection technique to gain access to the tip of the trochanter, which was followed by the insertion of the intramedullary guide wire. A protection drill sleeve was used to the trochanter and progressive reaming was performed until the diameter was 1 mm greater than that of the selected nail. After proximal reaming up to 16 mm, nail was manually inserted up to an adequate depth under fluoroscopic guidance, which was followed by positioning of blade guide wire. The blade was positioned in the center or distal third of the femoral neck on the anteroposterior view and in the middle third of the femoral neck on the lateral view. The blade was inserted and locked with the closure of fracture gap that was followed by application of a distal screw with gig and protection sleeve. End caps were not applied in all the cases because nearly none of the implants were to be removed. In the drained group, a hemovac drain (Zimmer Biomet, Autotransfusion System [HAS], United State) was placed beneath the fascia of the gluteus muscle, surrounding the entry point of the nail at the fracture site. The fascia of the gluteus muscle was repaired with absorbable sutures, Vicryl 1-0. The duration of operation was defined as the interval between the initiation of reduction and the wound closure.\n\nPostoperative care All the patients received a prophylactic antibiotic therapy of 1 g cefazolin every 8 hours for 1 day after surgery. All wounds were covered with a surgical dressing only and wound care was practiced on postoperative days 1, 2, and 4. The drain was removed within 24 hours based on the drainage condition, except when more than 250 ml fluid was drained in 24 hours 2, 12. Hb and Hct were examined on postoperative days 1, 2, and 4. The criterion for postoperative BT was a hemoglobin level of less than 8 mg/dL or presence of symptoms indicative of hypoxia. To control postoperative pain due to the influence of different anesthetic methods, the investigators measured visual analog score (VAS) at rest from postoperative day 1. The basic regimen after surgery was a combination of oral analgesics, acetaminophen and etoricoxib. After receiving the combination therapy, if the VAS score was more than 5, the investigators administered a subcutaneous morphine injection for pain control.\n\nPostoperative rehabilitation All the patients were encouraged to mobilize as early as possible to prevent complications associated with immobilization. Passive rehabilitation, including passive range of motion of the affected lower limb and practice for sitting at the edge of the bed, was initiated on postoperative day 1. Partial weight bearing ambulation and rehabilitation with walker was commenced on postoperative day 2. The extent of weight bearing was adjusted by the surgeon based on the stability of the fracture and the physical strength of the patient. Morphine was administered to patients when required during the rehabilitation period.\n\nData collection One independent observer who was not involved with the treatment performed the clinical assessments and laboratory data collection during the preoperative and intraoperative periods and on postoperative days 1, 2, and 4 (during admission) and on postoperative day 10 for suture removal.\n\nPrimary outcome The investigators defined TBL and BT as primary outcome variables that were calculated in millimeter. TBL was measured using the Mercuriali's formula because of its accuracy, which was based on previous studies. Mercuriali's formula: TBL = blood volume (BV) \u00d7 (Hct [preop] - Hct [POD 4] + transfused RBC [mL])\n\nSecondary outcome The clinical outcomes included body temperature, VAS (for pain assessment), opioid dosage (morphine equivalent), width of the injured proximal thigh (20 cm distal to the ipsilateral anterior superior iliac spine [ASIS]), wound condition, and the other laboratory data. The wound condition was assessed based on criteria described previously with specific reference to hematoma formation and wound infection. The severity of hematoma surrounding the wound site was classified into 3 grades as follows: none, moderate (ecchymosis without swelling), and severe (ecchymosis with swelling of the wound, resulting in tension on the skin sutures) [Fig. 2]. Wound infection was classified in 2 groups: superficial infection and deep infection. A wound infection was defined as superficial when 3 of the following symptoms occurred: fever, wound discharge, and wound redness, which usually could be controlled with antibiotic prescription. A deep wound infection involved the tissue beneath the fascia of the gluteus muscle and the implant, which usually required debridement or revision. The investigators recorded hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels on postoperative days 1, 2, and 4 as secondary laboratory outcomes.\n\nStatistical analysis The primary objective of the study was to determine whether routine drainage in PFNA fixation for ITFs is useful. Descriptive statistics, including estimated mean and standard deviation, for continuous variables and percentages and frequencies for categorical variables were tabulated and presented. Because the sample size of both the groups was small, a nonparametric method, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for comparing continuous variables and the Fisher's exact test was used to analyze the categorical variables. Box and whisker plots were used to demonstrate the BT and TBL distribution between the drained and undrained groups for intertrochanteric fracture treated with PFNA.

anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) and Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) therapy. These treatments are used to terminate the irregular heartbeats and bring the heart back to a normal rhythm. Catheter ablation is a procedure used to eliminate (damage) the heart cells causing the arrhythmia. Patients eligible for this may benefit from an ablation procedure in addition to an ICD to treat their VT condition or risk of developing VT. This study aims to show that treating VT with catheter ablation, if performed preemptively at the time of ICD implantation, will reduce subsequent recurrent VT, ICD shocks, and lead to improved survival.", "DetailedDescription": "Subjects who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be entered into the randomized trial. Randomization will be 1:1 between control group and ablation group. Those randomized to the control group will receive ICD therapy and routine drug therapy (including antiarrhythmic drugs as indicated). Subjects randomized to the ablation group will receive ablation therapy plus ICD for ventricular tachycardia. Patients that refuse ICD therapy and undergo ablation only will be enrolled in a prospective registry.\n\nFollow-up will be performed prior to hospital discharge for incision check and device interrogation as is standard of care. In addition, routine device and clinical follow-up will be scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Electrocardiography (ECG) will be performed pre-implant and prior to hospital discharge. Echocardiography (TTE) will be performed pre-implant and at 12 and 24 months.\n\nPatients that refuse ICD implantation will not be randomized and will be approached for inclusion into a registry if they undergo catheter ablation without an ICD. Basic demographics and medical history will be collected from registry subjects upon enrollment. Registry subjects will receive follow-up for routine clinical care every 6 months to check on their overall status.\n\n120 subjects will be randomized. An additional 60 subjects will enrolled into the registry.\n\nAs of the time protocol revision C changes were made (07Nov2016), 33 subjects have been randomized.

investigational malaria vaccines are safe as well as protective against malaria in adults living in the United States", "DetailedDescription": "35 volunteers aged 18 to 50 years will be enrolled to receive one of 2 investigational malaria vaccines. The vaccines are made of a malaria protein FMP2.1 mixed in 2 different adjuvants (AS01B and AS02A). Five volunteers will get a small (10 \u00b5g) dose of FMP2.1/AS01B since this vaccine has not yet been in humans. If it is safe, then 15 volunteers will get 50 \u00b5g FMP2.1 in AS02A and 15 will get 50 \u00b5g FMP2.1 in AS01B. All vaccines are given IM in the deltoid of the non-dominant arm, every 1 month for 3 months. After vaccination, the subjects will follow up at clinical trials for evaluation of any adverse events.\n\n20 vaccinees (10 from each 50 \u00b5g vaccine group) will undergo primary sporozoite challenge 14-30 days after dose 3 via bite of 5 malaria-infected mosquitoes. All subjects will have a blood slide prepared and read to check for asexual P. falciparum parasitemia at least once daily beginning day 5 post challenge. Beginning on day 10 post challenge, subjects will check into a designated hotel, where 24 hour evaluation and care will be available for 10 nights. After this hotel phase, there will be follow-up visits to ensure there are no late developments of malaria in those who have not fallen ill (and thus are considered protected).\n\nAny subject who tests positive for malaria will be treated with chloroquine. Efficacy readouts are complete protection or significant delay in patency defined as >2 days than the median prepatent period for the 6 infectivity controls. These 6 controls receive no vaccine and are enrolled for malaria-challenge only in order to provide comparison group for vaccinated individuals."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition": ["Malaria"]}, "KeywordList": {"Keyword": ["malaria", "vaccine", "AMA-1 (apical membrane antigen-1)", "efficacy"]}}, "DesignModule": {"StudyType": "Interventional", "PhaseList": {"Phase": ["Phase 1", "Phase 2"]}, "DesignInfo": {"DesignAllocation": "Randomized", "DesignInterventionModel": "Parallel Assignment", "DesignPrimaryPurpose": "Prevention", "DesignMaskingInfo": {"DesignMasking": "Quadruple", "DesignWhoMaskedList": {"DesignWhoMasked": ["Participant", "Care Provider", "Investigator", "Outcomes Assessor"]}}}, "EnrollmentInfo": {"EnrollmentCount": "41", "EnrollmentType": "Actual"}}, "ArmsInterventionsModule": {"ArmGroupList": {"ArmGroup": [{"ArmGroupLabel": "Group A", "ArmGroupType": "Experimental", "ArmGroupDescription": "FMP 2.1 50 \u03bcg FMP2.1/AS01B", "ArmGroupInterventionList": {"ArmGroupInterventionName": ["Biological: Group A FMP2.1/AS01B"]}}, {"ArmGroupLabel": "Group B", "ArmGroupType": "Experimental", "ArmGroupDescription": "FMP 2.1 50 \u03bcg FMP2.1/AS02A", "ArmGroupInterventionList": {"ArmGroupInterventionName": ["Biological: Group B FMP2.1/AS02A"]}}]}, "InterventionList": {"Intervention": [{"InterventionType": "Biological", "InterventionName": "Group A FMP2.1/AS01B", "InterventionArmGroupLabelList": {"InterventionArmGroupLabel": ["Group A"]}, "InterventionOtherNameList": {"InterventionOtherName": ["FMP 2.1 50 \u03bcg FMP2.1/AS01B"]}}, {"InterventionType": "Biological", "InterventionName": "Group B FMP2.1/AS02A", "InterventionArmGroupLabelList": {"InterventionArmGroupLabel": ["Group B"]}, "InterventionOtherNameList": {"InterventionOtherName": ["FMP 2.1 50 \u03bcg FMP2.1/AS02A"]}}]}}, "OutcomesModule": {"PrimaryOutcomeList": {"PrimaryOutcome": [{"PrimaryOutcomeMeasure": "Number of adverse events", "PrimaryOutcomeTimeFrame": "Up to 1 year"}]}, "SecondaryOutcomeList": {"SecondaryOutcome": [{"SecondaryOutcomeMeasure": "Anti-AMA-1 antibody titers during Immunization Phase", "SecondaryOutcomeTimeFrame": "Up to 70 days"}, {"SecondaryOutcomeMeasure": "Anti-AMA-I antibody titers during Challenge Phase", "SecondaryOutcomeTimeFrame": "Up to 90 days"}, {"SecondaryOutcomeMeasure": "Anti-AMA-I antibodies as percent parasite growth inhibition during Immunization Phase", "SecondaryOutcomeTimeFrame": "Up to 70 days"}, {"SecondaryOutcomeMeasure": "Anti-AMA-I antibodies as percent parasite growth inhibition during Challenge Phase", "SecondaryOutcomeTimeFrame": "Up to 90 days"}, {"SecondaryOutcomeMeasure": "Time to parasitemia development after primary challenge following administration of the FMP2.l/ASOIB and FMP2.l /AS02A", "SecondaryOutcomeTimeFrame": "Up to 1 Year"}]}}, "EligibilityModule": {"EligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nA male or non-pregnant female 18 to 50 years of age (inclusive) at the time of screening\nWritten informed consent obtained from the participant before screening procedures\nFree of clinically significant health problems as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study*\nAvailable to participate for duration of study (approximately five months, not including screening)\nIf the participant is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e., either surgically sterilized or one year post-menopausal; or, if of childbearing potential, she must be abstinent or have used adequate contraceptive precautions (e.g., intrauterine contraceptive device; oral contraceptives; diaphragm or condom in combination with contraceptive jelly, cream or foam; Norplant\u00ae or Depo-Provera\u00ae) during this study, have a negative pregnancy test at the time of each immunization, and must agree to continue such precautions for two months after completion of the immunization series and the malaria challenge.\nPrior to entry into this study, participants must score at least 80% correct on a short multiple-choice quiz that assesses their understanding of this study.

Up to 1 year of retrospective lipid treatment, lipid measurement patterns, and CV data in subjects with ASCVD meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria at enrolled clinical sites will be captured. The retrospective data collection is being performed for the following reasons:\n\nCapture relevant factors related to subject's CV risk and pertinent medical history.\n\nCapture changes in LLT over time as related to the subject's clinical condition and medical history and adverse events to LLT Eligible subjects will be invited to enroll in chronological order of attending the clinic. The study will enroll 3 subject cohorts with the following rationale:\n\nthe first cohort will consist of approximately 500 subjects on PCSK9i at the time of enrollment. The goal is to include a large enough cohort of patients receiving PCSK9i in real world clinical practice; this will allow (for the first time) to better understand the characteristics of those patients whose treatment is escalated to include PCSK9i, the therapeutic effects of PCSK9i outside of the randomized clinical trial settings, and over a prolonged duration of follow up;\nthe second cohort will enroll approximately 2000 subjects with LDL-C levels greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL. The purpose is to include a large group of patients with established ASCVD and suboptimal LDL control in order to better understand the treatment patterns and rates of CV events in this group;\nthe third group will enroll approximately 2500 subjects with LDL-C levels between 70 and 99 mg/dL. The purpose is to include a large group of patients with established ASCVD and more optimal control of LDL.\nTo better understand patient characteristics, lipid-lowering treatment management, rates of CV events, and potential opportunities for further LLT optimization in this group. Interactive voice response system will be used to track the number of subjects in each cohort. Once a cohort is filled, no more subjects may be enrolled into it. After the first subject is enrolled and annually thereafter, physicians will fill out a questionnaire on their general use of LLT type and dose and their overall goals of lipid management. The study specific data collection points are aligned with the standard of care physician scheduled visits. Each subject will be followed through a systematic series of medical chart reviews conducted at participating clinical sites. Initial chart reviews will occur at subject enrollment with subsequent scanning of charts occurring at the site every 6 months thereafter. In addition, questionnaires will be administered to subjects every 6 months via a CATI system (wherein an interviewer will ask the subject a series of standard questions) to determine general perceptions and attitudes towards LLT. The order of questions in the questionnaire will be based on subject response. This will facilitate reports of the number of inpatient visits, outpatient visits, outpatient procedures, diagnostic tests, prescription and nonprescription medication use in the prior 6 months. Subjects will be asked to complete questionnaires even if they do not routinely see the enrolling physician or if they have switched providers."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition":

{"OversightHasDMC": "Yes"}, "DescriptionModule": {"BriefSummary": "Project Aware is a randomized controlled clinical trial in which individuals seeking medical or health services at sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics are recruited to participate in a multi-center HIV testing and counseling study. The investigators will assess the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of (1) on-site HIV rapid testing with brief, participant-tailored prevention counseling vs. (2) on-site HIV rapid testing with information only. The investigators will evaluate the effect of counseling on one primary outcome: STI incidence. Secondary outcomes will be reduction of sexual risk behaviors, substance use during sex (i.e., being under the influence during sex) and cost and cost effectiveness of counseling and testing. Participants will be assessed for sexually transmitted infections, HIV testing history and sexual and drug use risk behaviors at baseline and at 6-months follow-up. Approximately 5,000 individuals seeking medical or health services from approximately 9 STD clinics throughout the United States will be randomized. These individuals will be 18 years of age or older and efforts will be made to recruit a sample of study participants that reflects the proportion of minorities and gender in the STD clinic performance sites from which the investigators are recruiting.", "DetailedDescription": "An estimated 56,300 Americans are newly infected with HIV every year. In addition, of the more than one million Americans living with HIV, approximately one-fifth do not know they are infected. Identifying these individuals is among the biggest challenges for HIV prevention in the United States. Early diagnosis of such individuals, combined with prevention counseling and provision of health care, could decrease the spread of HIV and improve the survival of HIV-infected persons.\n\nThe recent introduction of rapid HIV testing offers a critical public health screening approach for facilitating earlier diagnoses of HIV infection. Rapid tests permit a sensitive and specific, fast, simple, minimally invasive, and cost-effective method to screen for HIV.\n\nProject Aware expands on the CDC's Project RESPECT-2 study that was an expansion of the RESPECT study (a randomized controlled trial conducted in STD clinics in the mid-1990s before the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy and before the advent of rapid testing). Project RESPECT demonstrated that a 2-session, client centered counseling session based on behavioral theory with HIV testing was superior to a program with HIV testing and information only. This project showed that the counseling arm had significant reduction of STIs compared to those in the information arm. However, RESPECT did not include men who have sex with men (who account for 53% of all new HIV infections in the U.S.) and did not examine the cost effectiveness of the intervention. RESPECT-2 did include MSM, but it only compared a 1-session counseling session with rapid testing to 2-session counseling with traditional testing and did not address the question of whether counseling and testing is more effective than testing alone.\n\nProject Aware combines the RESPECT-2 counseling approach by adapting the HIV Rapid Testing and Counseling in Drug Abuse Treatment Study (CTN 0032), a NIDA-sponsored randomized controlled clinical trial being conducted in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network (CTN) to sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics to provide important and timely data on the effect of counseling in high-risk populations tested in health care settings. In this adaptation of CTN 0032, we will assess the relative effectiveness of (1) on-site HIV rapid testing with brief, participant-tailored prevention counseling vs. (2) on-site HIV rapid testing with information only (as recommended in the CDC guidelines). Secondary outcomes are reduction of sexual risk behaviors, substance use during sex (i.e., being under the influence during sex) and cost and cost effectiveness of counseling and testing. Participants (approximately 5,000 from 9 STD clinics) will be assessed for STIs, HIV testing history and sexual and drug use risk behaviors at baseline and at 6-months follow-up. The battery of STI tests will screen for Neisseria gonorrhea (GC), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Trichomonas vaginalis, Herpes Simplex 2 (HSV-2) and Treponema pallidum (syphilis). HIV test results that yield a reactive result will receive a confirmatory HIV blood test that day, with results delivered 5-10 days later. All participants will be randomized into one of two arms: Group 1- HIV testing and brief, client-centered counseling or Group 2- HIV testing and information only. Group 1 will receive a rapid HIV test with brief prevention counseling that addresses risk reduction based on an evidence-based counseling approach (RESPECT-2 counseling), while Group 2 will receive a rapid HIV test with information only.\n\nThe primary outcome will be analyzed using logistic regression for the binary outcome, new diagnoses of STIs (Yes/No). The logistic regression analysis will predict 6-month STI incidence as a function of randomization group controlling for the baseline incidence of STI. ANCOVA will be used for the secondary continuous outcomes, number of sexual risk behaviors and number of sexual episodes involving substance use. Costs will be compared based on study records supplemented by site-level data collection. Primary analyses will be performed under intent-to-treat (ITT) criteria."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition": ["HIV/AIDS", "Sexually Transmitted Infections"]}, "KeywordList": {"Keyword": ["HIV", "Rapid Testing", "Counseling", "STD", "U.S."]}}, "DesignModule": {"StudyType": "Interventional", "PhaseList": {"Phase": ["Not Applicable"]}, "DesignInfo": {"DesignAllocation": "Randomized", "DesignInterventionModel": "Parallel Assignment", "DesignPrimaryPurpose": "Screening", "DesignMaskingInfo": {"DesignMasking": "Single", "DesignWhoMaskedList": {"DesignWhoMasked": ["Investigator"]}}}, "EnrollmentInfo": {"EnrollmentCount": "5012", "EnrollmentType": "Actual"}}, "ArmsInterventionsModule": {"ArmGroupList": {"ArmGroup": [{"ArmGroupLabel": "Rapid HIV Testing w/ Counseling (Group 1)", "ArmGroupType": "Experimental", "ArmGroupDescription": "Individuals who screen as eligible will complete written informed consent procedures, be enrolled, be tested for STIs, and be asked to complete a baseline assessment using audio computer-assisted self interview (ACASI).

smoking cessation is the most significant preventable health behavior change that a person can make to lower cancer risk. In addition, telephone quitlines are an effective, science-based smoking cessation treatment that is universally accessible to smokers in the U.S. However, little research has explored promising approaches that could increase quitline use, improve quit rates, and inform resource allocation for quitline services. The proposed study will test three promising enhancements to the standard quitline treatment that typically consists of counseling and, possibly 2 weeks of a NRT medication. These enhancements are: 1) combination nicotine replacement therapy as recommended by the United States Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guideline on Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence; 2) extended duration of cessation medication use; and 3) an innovative counseling addition - cognitive medication adherence counseling - to optimize adherence to cessation medication. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of each intervention will be calculated. The findings of the proposed research have broad potential application and relevance to state quitlines, quitline service providers, and other purchasers of quitline services such as employers and insurers. Additionally, the study findings can potentially inform other telephone health behavior counseling programs.", "DetailedDescription": "The study design is a fully crossed 2x2x2 factorial design that tested the effect of two versus six weeks of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), the effect of NRT monotherapy (nicotine patch alone) versus NRT combination therapy (nicotine patch + oral NRT), and the effect of cognitive medication adherence counseling (CMAC) versus no CMAC. A total of 987 smokers seeking cessation assistance from the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL) were randomly assigned to the eight (2x2x2) different conditions generated by the three experimental factors. This design provides us with sufficient power to analyze each of our three main effects listed above. We will also test for two- and three-way interactions, but do not have sufficient data to make a priori assumptions about interaction effects. Finally, we will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis for each of the three interventions to allow readers of this research to evaluate whether the additional costs of the interventions yield sufficient gains to warrant implementing them broadly."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition": ["Smoking", "Smoking Cessation"]}, "KeywordList": {"Keyword": ["Smoking", "Smoking

Prostate cancer is the leading cancer affecting veterans and the second leading cancer among all Americans. The causes of prostate cancer and, particularly, the reasons for the unusually high incidence rates in African-Americans remain obscure. Dietary factors likely play a role in fatal cases, while hormones are also important in regulating prostate cancer growth. Dr. Charles Huggins recognized this effect in the 1940's, with androgen deprivation remaining as the cornerstone of therapy for advanced disease. Despite the strong circumstantial evidence, neither epidemiologic studies nor basic sciences have produced clear insight into the etiologic role of hormones. However, recent observations regarding androgen receptor gene polymorphisms and their relation to endocrine expression and prostate cancer risk may be providing important clues as to how an etiologic role might be mediated at the molecular level. Thus, it is important to attempt to identify genetic markers of high-risk cancer patients for necessary screening and counseling efforts.\n\nIt has been recently demonstrated that the androgen receptor functions as a ligand-dependent transcriptional regulator, and that this regulation is important in controlling prostate growth and apoptosis. Heightened androgenic stimulation, a potential by-product of shortened CAG repeat length, could potentially increase the risk of prostate cancer development and progression. In particular, a shorter CAG repeat sequence may be associated with cancers that have features of higher histologic grade, extraprostatic extension, and distant metastases (stage C or D). Recent evidence indicates that men with shorter CAG repeats are at particularly higher risk for distant metastatic and fatal prostate cancer. The results demonstrated that a shorter CAG repeat sequence in the androgen receptor gene predicted higher grade and advanced state of prostate cancer at diagnosis, metastatic disease, and mortality. However, these studies have been limited to whites since only a small number of African American men with prostate cancer were included.\n\nProstate cancer incidence varies between African-American and white men. African-American men have the highest known incidence rates in the world, 66% higher than white men in the U.S. The genetic findings described above raise the possibility that racial differences in the distribution of androgen receptor polymorphisms may account for the higher rate of prostate cancer, the more advanced disease, and the younger age at presentation in African-Americans.\n\nThis study created a cohort of prostate cancer patients who are well characterized with respect to histology, stage of diagnosis, and (over time) mortality. This study is generating data regarding the length of the CAG repeat sequence occurring in the androgen receptor gene and major prostate cancer prognostic determinants (histologic grade and state) at the time of diagnosis in black and white veterans. CAG repeat lengths on the androgen receptor gene were evaluated for a cohort of 145 African American and 150 white veterans with prostate cancer.\n\nResults: Mean androgen receptor gene CAG repeat lengths for Caucasians was 21.9 versus 19.8 for African Americans, p=0.0001. However, a truncated CAG repeat length (CAG <= 18 versus CAG > 18) was not associated with advanced stage of cancer at diagnosis, higher PSA at diagnosis, or higher Gleason score (each with p>0.5).\n\nConclusion: The mean androgen receptor CAG repeat length was 2 repeats shorter for African American versus white prostate cancer patients. These findings raise concern that prostate cancers in African American men may be less sensitive to hormonal therapy than those in white men. These findings provide biologic rationale for clinical trials that evaluate the joint administration of chemotherapy and hormone therapy for African American men with advanced prostate cancer."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition": ["Prostate Cancer", "Prostatic Neoplasms"]}, "KeywordList": {"Keyword": ["Prostate cancer", "CAG repeat sequence"]}}, "DesignModule": {"StudyType": "Observational"}, "EligibilityModule": {"EligibilityCriteria": "Veterans who undergo prostate biopsy where biopsy results are positive or PSA less than 10Ng/ml.", "HealthyVolunteers": "No", "Gender": "Male", "MinimumAge": "18 Years", "StdAgeList": {"StdAge": ["Adult", "Older Adult"]}}, "ContactsLocationsModule": {"LocationList": {"Location": [{"LocationFacility": "Vamc - Chicago-Lakeside, Il", "LocationCity": "Chicago", "LocationState": "Illinois", "LocationZip": "60611", "LocationCountry": "United States"}]}}}, "DerivedSection": {"MiscInfoModule": {"VersionHolder": "October 26, 2020"}, "ConditionBrowseModule": {"ConditionMeshList": {"ConditionMesh": [{"ConditionMeshId": "D000011471", "ConditionMeshTerm": "Prostatic Neoplasms"}]}, "ConditionAncestorList": {"ConditionAncestor": [{"ConditionAncestorId": "D000005834", "ConditionAncestorTerm": "Genital Neoplasms, Male"}, {"ConditionAncestorId": "D000014565", "ConditionAncestorTerm": "Urogenital Neoplasms"}, {"ConditionAncestorId": "D000009371", "ConditionAncestorTerm": "Neoplasms by Site"}, {"ConditionAncestorId": "D000009369", "ConditionAncestorTerm": "Neoplasms"}, {"ConditionAncestorId": "D000011469", "ConditionAncestorTerm": "Prostatic Diseases"}]}, "ConditionBrowseLeafList": {"ConditionBrowseLeaf": [{"ConditionBrowseLeafId": "M12918", "ConditionBrowseLeafName": "Prostatic Neoplasms", "ConditionBrowseLeafAsFound": "Prostate Cancer", "ConditionBrowseLeafRelevance": "high"}, {"ConditionBrowseLeafId": "M7529", "ConditionBrowseLeafName": "Genital Neoplasms, Male", "ConditionBrowseLeafRelevance": "low"}, {"ConditionBrowseLeafId": "M15898", "ConditionBrowseLeafName": "Urogenital Neoplasms", "ConditionBrowseLeafRelevance": "low"}, {"ConditionBrowseLeafId": "M12916", "ConditionBrowseLeafName": "Prostatic Diseases", "ConditionBrowseLeafRelevance": "low"}]}, "ConditionBrowseBranchList": {"ConditionBrowseBranch": [{"ConditionBrowseBranchAbbrev": "BC04", "ConditionBrowseBranchName": "Cancers and Other Neoplasms"}, {"ConditionBrowseBranchAbbrev": "BXS", "ConditionBrowseBranchName": "Urinary Tract, Sexual Organs, and Pregnancy Conditions"}, {"ConditionBrowseBranchAbbrev": "All", "ConditionBrowseBranchName": "All Conditions"}]}}}}}, {"Rank": 78, "Study": {"ProtocolSection": {"IdentificationModule": {"NCTId": "NCT02163525", "OrgStudyIdInfo": {"OrgStudyId": "CP-00-0025"}, "Organization": {"OrgFullName": "Acessa Health, Inc.", "OrgClass": "INDUSTRY"}, "BriefTitle": "Post Market TRUST - U.S.A.

EFs comprise a complex, multi-faceted brain system necessary to pay attention, overcome habitual and automatic behaviors, regulate mood, and ensure that current behavior is in line with short and long-term goals.Yet, protracted periods of high uncertainty, high demands, and high stress can lead to decreases in the efficiency and availability of EFs. Given the high demands and psychological vulnerabilities that U.S. Army personnel may face, it is critical to provide them with training programs to protect against degradation of EFs (particularly attention and working memory) over high-stress, high-demand intervals. Prior research on mindfulness training (MT) in civilians and military servicemembers showed that MT can effectively protect against degradation in attention and working memory and benefit psychological well-being over high-demand intervals.\n\nProblem: While being successful, prior MT programs required a considerable amount of time dedicated to training (e.g., 24-hour training) and it is challenging to integrate these long programs into the busy schedule of the U.S. Army personnel. To accommodate the time constraints, the principal investigator together with a mindfulness expert developed a short-form mindfulness training program contextualized for the U.S. Army; the program consists of 8-hour training and is known as MBAT, Mindfulness-Based Attention Training.\n\nProject Goal: The present study aims to investigate the best practices for delivery of a short-form mindfulness training to U.S. Army Cohorts. Specifically, the present study will examine the best delivery structure for the MBAT by comparing MBAT course delivered in 2 weeks vs. 4 weeks."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition": ["Psychological Stress", "Anxiety", "Post Traumatic Stress Disorder", "Depression", "Cognitive Change"]}}, "DesignModule": {"StudyType": "Interventional", "PhaseList": {"Phase": ["Not Applicable"]}, "DesignInfo": {"DesignAllocation": "Non-Randomized", "DesignInterventionModel": "Parallel Assignment", "DesignInterventionModelDescription": "Participants will be assigned into three groups: (i) a 4-week MT group (MT4, n = 40) that will receive MBAT in 4, 2-hour sessions over 4 weeks; (ii) a 2-week MT group (MT2, n = 40) that will receive MBAT in 4, 2-hour sessions over 2 weeks; (iii) a no-training control group that will be tested before and after a no-training interval (NTC4, n = 40). After the end of the course sessions, participants from the training groups will still be assigned homework exercises until third testing session (T3). Hence, the MBAT program consists of delivery of the MBAT course, including homework mindfulness practice, and followed by an interval of homework mindfulness practice without course meetings.\n\nThe design relies on group randomization at the level of individual military cohort units.

Use of shade is recommended by health authorities worldwide. However, shade provision requires expensive physical environment changes and may be effective only when health education has created a social environment (e.g., norms) that motivates its use. A multi-national research team will explore the use of built shade in passive recreation areas (i.e., areas for sitting/ standing while socializing, preparing/eating a meal, watching/coaching sports, watching a concert, taking a class, or waiting, or areas where people stroll for sightseeing, while observing outdoor displays, or shopping) within public parks and compare use between the United States (i.e., Denver, Colorado) and Australia (i.e., Melbourne, Victoria) to prospectively test the moderating influence of social environment on the built environment. Pilot studies confirmed that adults in Melbourne had stronger sun protection habits and norms than adults in Denver. The specific aims of the project are to: a) introduce built shade structures (i.e., shade sails) in public parks in Denver and Melbourne; b) compare the use of passive recreation areas with and without built shade; c) compare the change in use of the passive recreation areas in Denver and Melbourne after introduction of built shade, and d) examine the relationship among social environment and physical features of the environment and built shade.The research team will build shade sails at passive recreation areas in public parks and compare use of the passive recreation areas to unshaded passive recreation areas in a randomized pretest-posttest controlled design. Passive recreation areas will be enrolled in one of three annual sample waves and stratified by location (72 in Denver and 72 in Melbourne). In each wave, passive recreation areas will be pretested in a first summer, further stratified based on baseline use, and randomized following pretest to construction of a shade sail or an untreated control group in a 1:3 ratio. Posttesting will occur the following summer, after construction of the shade sails. In total, 36 passive recreation areas will be randomized to the intervention group with shade sail construction (18 per city) and 108 passive recreation areas to the untreated control group with no shade sails (54 per city). The primary outcome measure will be use of the passive recreation areas, observed by trained research assistants. The secondary outcome measure will be the potential ultraviolet radiation exposure, assessed by hand-held meters during the observations of the passive recreation areas. Data collection will occur during 30-minute periods between 11 am and 3 pm on on 4 weekend days over 20-weeks in the summer.

nausea, and vomiting. In the U.S., it is estimated that there are 20 cases of pyelonephritis per 10,000 annually, with the highest incidence in young women. Escherichia coli (E. coli) causes over 80% of these infections. Over the last two decades, E. coli resistance has emerged to commonly prescribed antimicrobials, such as ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Most recently, resistance to fluoroquinolones and strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) have been observed. In order to better understand the evolution and current state of antibiotic resistance among E. coli urinary tract isolates so as to better inform treatment decisions, the investigators propose to conduct an investigation to: a) determine the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among E. coli causing acute pyelonephritis in various patient groups, and specifically healthy community-dwellers with uncomplicated infections, b) determine the specific prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistance and ESBL-producing E. coli, and c) determine potential risk factors for fluoroquinolone and ESBL-producing E. coli infections."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition": ["Pyelonephritis"]}}, "DesignModule": {"StudyType": "Observational", "PatientRegistry": "No", "DesignInfo": {"DesignObservationalModelList": {"DesignObservationalModel": ["Case-Only"]}, "DesignTimePerspectiveList": {"DesignTimePerspective": ["Prospective"]}}, "EnrollmentInfo": {"EnrollmentCount": "720", "EnrollmentType": "Actual"}}, "ArmsInterventionsModule": {"ArmGroupList": {"ArmGroup": [{"ArmGroupLabel": "pyelonephritis", "ArmGroupDescription": "Patients > 18 years of age with flank pain and/or costovertebral angle tenderness, documented temperature in the emergency department of \u226538\u00b0C/100.4\u00b0F by any method of measurement, and clinically suspected acute pyelonephritis.

The future holds promise of the development of therapies that will promote degrees of repair and recovery of function for people living with SCI. Lessons learned from past \"failed\" SCI clinical trials, however, demonstrate that, in order to accurately evaluate the overall effectiveness of SCI therapies, more sensitive outcomes measures are needed. Specifically, and reflecting the ultimate goal of clinical interventions - inducing functional recovery - the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM), has been recommended for further testing and development for use as a measure of functional ability in future SCI clinical studies. The SCIM is a very simple questionnaire and score sheet that an evaluator uses to determine how independently a person with SCI can perform certain tasks.\n\nA panel of SCI researchers recommended the SCIM as the most suitable among four candidate measures of functional recovery reviewed at a special meeting sponsored by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) at a joint meeting of the American Spinal Injury Association and the International Spinal Cord Society (ASIA-ISCoS) in Boston, MA, in June 2006. It was recommended that a large-scale, multi-center, prospective trial be conducted in the United States, which would mirror a recently published multi-site international study.\n\nThe proposed research on the SCIM III, the latest and most sensitive version of the SCIM, would test the hypothesis that the SCIM III is a valid, reliable, and sensitive measure of functional ability in persons with SCI. Twenty-two rehabilitation centers throughout the United States will enroll a maximum of 660 subjects. Functional ability will be measured with the SCIM III during the first week of admittance into inpatient acute rehabilitation and within one week of discharge from the same rehabilitation program. Statistical analyses will be used to test the validity, reliability, and sensitivity of the SCIM III. The results will demonstrate whether the SCIM III is a suitable outcome measure to assess SCI specific functional ability in future clinical trials.", "DetailedDescription": "STUDY PURPOSE This clinical research study will be performed to assess the validity, reliability, and sensitivity of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM III) in measuring functional ability in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI).\n\nAims and Hypothesis:\n\nOverall hypothesis - The SCIM III is a valid, reliable, and sensitive measure of functional ability in persons with SCI.\n\nAim 1: Examine the validity of the SCIM III as an outcome measure to assess functional ability in persons with SCI.\n\nCriterion-related validity\nConstruct validity of components\n\nAim 2: Examine the reliability of SCIM III evaluations.\n\nInter-rater reliability\nInternal consistency\n\nAim 3: Examine the sensitivity of the SCIM III to functional change.\n\nSensitivity to functional change compared to the Functional Independence Measure (FIM).\nSensitivity to functional change over time\n\nSTUDY DESIGN This is a multi-center, prospective clinical research study performed to assess the validity, reliability, and sensitivity of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM III) in measuring functional ability in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI).\n\nUCI will act as the coordinating center for this study, collecting and performing statistical data analysis.

Participating facilities will be offered vaccine education for residents and staff, but will be randomly allocated to receive aTIV (FLUAD) vaccine or usual care (TIV) vaccination for their residents.\n\nBACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRI), including pneumonia, bronchitis, and tracheobronchitis, is the leading cause of infectious mortality and hospitalization in older adults , and nursing home (NH) residents. Pneumonia and infection often produce attenuated signs and symptoms in older adults, leading to delayed or even misdiagnosis for this population. Diagnosis is further compromised due to few and sporadic clinician visits with nursing home residents, and reduced access to radiology. LRI may or may not directly lead to hospitalization, but LRIs are associated with considerable other morbidity than can result in hospitalization, including exacerbation of underlying cardiopulmonary diseases. Hospitalization rates for NH residents vary considerably between facilities, but the majority of hospitalizations occur during the 12 weeks during which influenza peaks each year.\n\nOBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to estimate the differences in hospitalization rates during influenza season experienced by long-stay nursing home residents, between facilities using adjuvanted trivalent vaccine vs. standard trivalent vaccine. The secondary objective is to estimate the differences in the likelihood of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) functional decline and mortality rates in the study nursing homes, and influenza outbreaks."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition": ["Influenza", "Influenza-like Illness"]}, "KeywordList": {"Keyword": ["influenza", "vaccine", "vaccination", "nursing home", "cluster randomized trial", "respiratory-related hospitalization"]}}, "DesignModule": {"StudyType": "Interventional", "PhaseList": {"Phase": ["Phase 4"]}, "DesignInfo": {"DesignAllocation": "Randomized", "DesignInterventionModel": "Parallel Assignment", "DesignPrimaryPurpose": "Prevention", "DesignMaskingInfo": {"DesignMasking": "Single", "DesignWhoMaskedList": {"DesignWhoMasked": ["Outcomes Assessor"]}}}, "EnrollmentInfo": {"EnrollmentCount": "823", "EnrollmentType": "Actual"}}, "ArmsInterventionsModule": {"ArmGroupList": {"ArmGroup": [{"ArmGroupLabel": "aTIV", "ArmGroupType": "Experimental", "ArmGroupDescription": "NH facilities randomized to receive adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV, FLUAD) for the residents", "ArmGroupInterventionList": {"ArmGroupInterventionName": ["Biological: adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine", "Biological: trivalent influenza vaccine"]}}, {"ArmGroupLabel": "TIV", "ArmGroupType": "Active Comparator", "ArmGroupDescription": "NH facilities randomized to receive standard trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV, Fluvirin) for the residents", "ArmGroupInterventionList": {"ArmGroupInterventionName": ["Biological: trivalent influenza vaccine"]}}]}, "InterventionList": {"Intervention": [{"InterventionType": "Biological", "InterventionName": "adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine", "InterventionDescription": "Nursing home residents over 65 years are allocated to receive adjuvanted trivalent vaccine.

147,000 new cases and more than 56,000 deaths each year. Early detection of colon cancer and removal of precancerous adenomatous polyps have been shown to reduce its morbidity, mortality and incidence. There are several recommended CRC screening tests, including fecal occult blood test (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, air-contrast barium enema, and colonoscopy. In the VA, FOBT is the predominant screening test for CRC. Numerous randomized controlled trials have established the efficacy of FOBT in CRC screening. Its advantages include privacy, noninvasiveness, and cost-effectiveness. Use of guaiac-based testing, however, is hampered by low patient compliance, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. The poor patient compliance, and low specificity and positive predictive value, may be related to the testing procedure. For example, dietary and medication restrictions are recommended to decrease false-negative and false-positive tests. Such restrictions may impede patient compliance. Recently, several studies have evaluated the effectiveness immunochemical-based testing as a potential alternative, with reportedly better compliance, sensitivity, and specificity than guaiac-based tests. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the diagnostic validity of a new IFOBT (Teco Diagnostics) in U.S. veterans and to compare it with the guaiac based FOBT."}, "ConditionsModule":

Association between nativity and diet quality was done using multivariable-adjusted linear regression for the continuous total diet quality scores and their components, or multinomial (polytomous) logistic regression for categorical tertiles (low, medium, or high) of the total scores and their components. The study found that foreign-born Blacks had significantly higher AHEI-2010 and DASH scores compared to U.S-born Blacks, and more favorable intakes for many of the score components. Among foreign-born Blacks, diet quality did not significantly differ by length of residency. Foreign-born Blacks were more likely to be in the high than low tertile for fruit (including and excluding fruit juice), vegetables (excluding starchy vegetables), percent whole grains, and omega-3 fatty acids. Overall, the study suggests that foreign-born Blacks have better diet quality compared to their U.S.-born counterparts.

disease in humans immunized with a newly FDA approved meningococcal B vaccine, trade name \"Trumenba\u00ae\" manufactured by Pfizer Vaccines. As a secondary goal the investigators will investigate underlying mechanisms by which human anti-FHbp antibodies elicit complement-mediated bactericidal activity.", "DetailedDescription": "Neisseria meningitidis causes meningitis and severe infections of the blood stream. The incidence of serogroup B meningococcal disease however is too low to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to determine the actual efficacy of the new serogroup B vaccines. Instead vaccine efficacy was inferred from serum bactericidal antibody responses using four test strains. However, because of strain variability of FHbp amino acid sequence (there are more than 800 sequence variants described) and strain variability of FHbp expression, bactericidal data on only four strains are unlikely to be sufficient to predict the actual strain coverage by the vaccine. There also are gaps in knowledge about the underlying mechanisms by which human antibodies to FHbp elicit complement mediated bactericidal activity. For example, binding of FH to FHbp is specific for human FH. Therefore in vaccinated humans the vaccine antigen is expected to form a complex with FH right after immunization. The investigators' hypothesis is that binding of human FH to the vaccine antigen skews the antibody repertoire to FHbp epitopes located outside of the FH combining site. The resulting antibodies would be expected not to inhibit binding of FH to the bacteria. This hypothesis will be investigated in Trumenba-immunized humans as part of studies in Aim 1 (and in future studies of recombinant human anti-FHbp Fabs that will be enabled by obtaining DNA from individual B cells, described in Aim 2)."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition": ["Meningococcal Infections"]}, "KeywordList": {"Keyword": ["Meningococcal Vaccines", "Neisseria Meningitidis", "Factor H-binding Protein"]}}, "DesignModule": {"StudyType": "Interventional", "PhaseList": {"Phase": ["Phase 4"]}, "DesignInfo": {"DesignAllocation": "N/A", "DesignInterventionModel": "Single Group Assignment", "DesignMaskingInfo": {"DesignMasking": "None (Open Label)"}}, "EnrollmentInfo": {"EnrollmentCount": "18", "EnrollmentType": "Anticipated"}}, "ArmsInterventionsModule": {"ArmGroupList": {"ArmGroup": [{"ArmGroupLabel": "Open Label: MenB-FHbp", "ArmGroupType": "Experimental", "ArmGroupDescription": "Trumenba Meningococcal Group B Vaccine (Wyeth/Pfizer Pharmaceuticals)", "ArmGroupInterventionList": {"ArmGroupInterventionName": ["Biological: Trumenba Vaccine (Wyeth/Pfizer Pharmaceuticals)"]}}]}, "InterventionList": {"Intervention": [{"InterventionType": "Biological", "InterventionName": "Trumenba Vaccine (Wyeth/Pfizer Pharmaceuticals)", "InterventionDescription": "All subjects will receive three doses of a Trumenba, a U.S.-licensed meningococcal vaccine.

of untreated psychosis (DUP) and improve outcomes beyond an established first-episode service (FES)?\n\nThe primary aim of this study is:\n\nTo determine whether an early detection intervention can reduce DUP in the US, as compared to usual detection. Early detection (ED) will be implemented in one US community (New Haven, CT), and usual detection efforts will continue in another (Boston, MA). DUP will be measured at admission to the corresponding first-episode services (STEP & PREP) in each community, over one year before and throughout ED implementation. The investigators hypothesize that DUP will be reduced significantly in the early detection site compared to the usual detection site;\nA secondary aim is to determine whether DUP reduction can augment the outcomes of established FES on outcomes in the U.S. The investigators will measure symptoms, functioning and engagement with treatment at entry and over 1 year at each site. The investigators hypothesize that shorter DUP at one FES (STEP) will predict reduced distress and illness severity at entry and better early outcomes at STEP compared to PREP.", "DetailedDescription": "Early detection, or reducing the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) can substantially ameliorate the distress and disability caused by psychotic illnesses. The TIPS project in Scandinavia used a combination of public and targeted education campaigns coupled with rapid availability of comprehensive services to improve the identification, referral and early treatment of psychotic illness. By targeting the dual 'bottlenecks' of inadequate mental health literacy and delayed access to effective treatment, TIPS significantly reduced DUP2 and experimentally demonstrated improved clinical presentations and outcomes.\n\nEffective service models for new onset psychosis exist in the U.S. Multi-element specialty 'first-episode' services (FES), highlighted in this FOA, provide care that is adapted to the specific needs of younger patients and their families and can improve symptoms and functional outcomes during the critical early phase of psychotic illnesses. The NIH-funded Specialized Treatment in Early Psychosis (STEP, New Haven) project, included the first U.S.-based randomized controlled trial to establish the feasibility and effectiveness of a public-sector approach to FES.5 The Prevention and Recovery in Early Psychosis (PREP, Boston) clinic has advanced a similar model of care within an analogous public-academic collaboration.\n\nWhat is required, as the next logical step, is a test of the effectiveness of TIPS' powerful approach to early detection in a policy-relevant U.S. setting, where relatively fragmented pathways to care raise both the challenges and potential public health impact of early detection. The expertise within the investigators investigative team in the design of early detection and the presence of 2 similar, effective, geographically separated and collaborative FES programs (STEP and PREP) presents an excellent opportunity to conduct such a test and thereby advance secondary prevention for psychotic illnesses in the U.S."}, "ConditionsModule": {"ConditionList": {"Condition": ["Psychosis", "Schizophrenia"]}}, "DesignModule": {"StudyType": "Interventional", "PhaseList": {"Phase": ["Not Applicable"]}, "DesignInfo": {"DesignAllocation": "Non-Randomized", "DesignInterventionModel": "Parallel Assignment", "DesignPrimaryPurpose": "Treatment", "DesignMaskingInfo": {"DesignMasking": "None (Open Label)"}}, "EnrollmentInfo": {"EnrollmentCount": "224", "EnrollmentType": "Anticipated"}}, "ArmsInterventionsModule": {"ArmGroupList": {"ArmGroup": [{"ArmGroupLabel": "Early Detection (ED)", "ArmGroupType": "Experimental", "ArmGroupDescription": "This intervention consists of educational campaigns directed at patients & families (who have yet to seek care) and professionals in educational and clinical settings to hasten referral of individuals with new onset psychosis to an established, best-practice first-episode service (i.e. STEP).
