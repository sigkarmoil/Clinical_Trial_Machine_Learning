              "BriefSummary":"Osteoarthritis (OA) most often affects the hip and knee joints. The first signs and symptoms of pain, stiffness or swelling are not uncommon in those in their thirties and forties and 10 per cent report symptomatic knee OA by age 60 years. Education and exercise are essential for people with OA to help them manage their condition better. Exercise can reduce pain, improve mobility and enhance quality of life. However, doing the right exercises in the right way is important so that joints are not overly stressed.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate an existing evidence-based program called, Good Life with osteoArthritis in Denmark (GLA:D). The program has been translated and adapted to the Canadian context and will now be implemented in a Canadian therapy setting to start to understand if it is effective. This is the first time this program is being tested in Canada.\n\nWhile some people have access to self-management programs for OA, these programs often provide only general exercise guidance and education. GLA:D integrates patient education and targeted, personalized exercise for people with hip and/or knee OA. Importantly, the exercises are taught so that individuals learn to incorporate them in their everyday activities. This research is the first step to understanding if people participating in this program have pain relief and improved function and if they are better able to manage their hip or knee OA symptoms. Additionally, this initial evaluation of the program will help create a better understanding of the challenges in delivering the program. This will be valuable information for offering future programs assuming success of this pilot study.\n\nIt is anticipated that about 60 people (30 hip OA and 30 knee OA) will participate in this study. These people will be recruited from the Sunnybrook Holland Orthopaedic and Arthritic Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. All consenting participants will receive the GLA:D Canada program delivered by Sunnybrook's therapists.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Arthritis affects over 4.7 million Canadians and the majority of them have hip and/or knee osteoarthritis (OA). Analysis by the Arthritis Alliance of Canada estimates one new OA diagnosis every 60 seconds. Poorly managed OA results in significant pain and disability, reduced quality of life (QOL), limits work productivity and increases use of health care resources. Two of 3 people are under 65 years and 10 percent of people report pain and functional problems from knee OA by age 60 years. Current evidence indicates that education related to OA integrated with exercises targeted to the hip and/or knee joints are effective in reducing symptoms and improving patient function and QOL. Unfortunately, in Canada, while there are some programs for people with bone and joint problems (e.g. OSTEOFIT, Fit & Strong) they are general education and exercise programs and are restricted to people over 60 years. In fact, a recent Bone and Joint Canada workshop identified implementation of evidence-based programs as the number one priority. Additionally, our research showed that people under 60 years are looking for strategies to relieve and prevent OA symptom progression. An evidence-based targeted program integrating patient education and exercise for people with hip and knee OA, Good Life with osteoArthritis in Denmark (GLA:D), was implemented in Denmark by collaborator Roos in 2012. GLA:D is delivered by trained physiotherapists and includes patient education sessions and group exercise twice weekly for six weeks. Importantly, exercises are performed in positions and conditions reflecting daily life emphasizing the quality of performance, proper body position and individualized progression based on the patient's ability. The practical nature of these exercises improves adherence to the exercises in the longer term as they are easily transferrable to daily activities. Feasibility, safety and benefit of GLA:D have been demonstrated in individuals with mild to severe hip and knee OA. Since 2012, more than 5000 patients have been educated in GLA:D. Ongoing benefits for more than 2000 patients with one-year follow-up include pain relief with reduced use of medication, improved function and QOL, return to work, and ongoing use of the new knowledge and skills. Given its successful implementation and outcomes, pilot testing of GLA:D Canada and then potential provincial and national implementation and evaluation is highly appealing to address an urgent need for Canadians with hip and knee OA."

              "BriefSummary":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide and affects more than 4.4 million people in Canada (13% of Canadians). OA symptoms include joint pain, stiffness, range of motion loss, and inflammation, resulting in a significant decrease in quality of life. Current evidence-based guidelines for OA management recommend weight loss, patient education, exercise therapy, bracing, viscosupplementation, and anti-inflammatory/pain medications prior to joint replacement surgery. Unfortunately, current practice trends are not consistent with these guidelines and focus largely on joint replacement. Recently, research from a group in Denmark has shown a reduction in the progression of knee OA symptoms, joint related painkiller use, individuals on sick leave, and higher physical activity levels 12 months after a combined patient education and standardized group exercise therapy program (GLA:D®). Based on the Danish success, the GLA:D® program has been made available in Canada. To date it is unclear if the GLA:DTM Canada program will result in outcomes similar to those seen in Denmark, or how the GLA:DTM program compares to existing individualized OA care programs (i.e. JointEffort). This research will answer the following three questions;\n\nIs the GLA:DTM standardized education and exercise program associated with improvements in functional mobility, quality of life, pain management, and inflammatory biomarkers in knee OA patients in Calgary, Alberta?\nIs the JointEffort individualized exercise and education program associated with improved functional mobility, quality of life, pain management, and inflammatory biomarkers in knee OA patients in Calgary, Alberta?\nDo the improvements in functional mobility, quality of life, pain management, and inflammatory biomarkers in knee OA patients differ between those enrolled in the GLA:DTM and the JointEffort education and exercise programs?",
              "DetailedDescription":"BACKGROUND:\n\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide and affects more than 4.4 million people in Canada (13% of Canadians). OA symptoms include joint pain, stiffness, range of motion loss, and inflammation, resulting in a significant decrease in quality of life. Current evidence-based guidelines for OA management recommend weight loss, patient education, exercise therapy, bracing, viscosupplementation, and anti-inflammatory/pain medications prior to joint replacement surgery. Unfortunately, current practice trends are not consistent with these guidelines and focus largely on joint replacement. Recently, research from a group in Denmark has shown a reduction in the progression of knee OA symptoms, joint related painkiller use, individuals on sick leave, and higher physical activity levels 12 months after a combined patient education and standardized group exercise therapy program (GLA:D®). Based on the Danish success, the GLA:D® program has been made available in Canada. To date it is unclear if the GLA:D® Canada program will result in outcomes similar to those seen in Denmark, or how the GLA:D® program compares to existing individualized OA care programs (i.e. JointEffort).\n\nRESEARCH QUESTIONS:\n\nIs the GLA:D® standardized education and exercise program associated with improvements in functional mobility, quality of life, pain management, and inflammatory biomarkers in knee OA patients in Alberta?\nIs the JointEffort individualized exercise and education program associated with improved functional mobility, quality of life, pain management, and inflammatory biomarkers in knee OA patients in Alberta?\nDo the improvements in functional mobility, quality of life, pain management, and inflammatory biomarkers in knee OA patients differ between those enrolled in the GLA:D® and the JointEffort education and exercise programs?\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n\nThe objectives of this pre-experimental intervention study are to 1) assess the association between participation in the GLA:D® standardized program and functional mobility, quality of life, pain management, and inflammatory biomarkers in knee OA patients, 2) assess the association between participation in the JointEffort individualized program and functional mobility, quality of life, pain management, and inflammatory biomarkers in knee OA patients, and 3) assess if there are any differences in outcomes between the standardized (GLA:D®) and individualized (JointEffort) exercise programs.\n\nMETHODOLOGY:\n\nStudy Participants: A convenience sample of 60 participants ≥50 years of age with a primary care physician or orthopedic surgeon knee OA diagnosis will be included in the study. Specifically, 30 individuals will participate in 1) the GLA:D® program and 30 sex- and age-matched individuals will participate in 2) the JointEffort program. 60 participants is a conservative estimate based on the ability to detect a moderate effect between study groups (1-β=0.8, α=0.05).\n\nExercise Programs: The GLA:D® program consists of 1) pre- and post-program outcome measurement (self-reported and functional outcomes); 2) 2, 1-1.5 hour education sessions including information on OA disease characteristics, treatments and self-help strategies; and 3) a neuromuscular exercise (warm-up, circuit training, and cool down) training program administered in 1 hour, small (up to 10 persons) group-based, supervised sessions twice weekly for 6 weeks. The goal of the exercises is to restore neutral, functional alignment of the legs by building compensatory functional stability and improving sensorimotor control. The JointEffort program consists of: 1) one appointment aimed at individualized program design; 2) a nutritional seminar taught by a registered dietician explaining dietary recommendations for OA patients and inflammatory conditions, including weight loss and/or management; and 3) an individualized exercise (strength and neuromuscular training, balance training, and range of motion exercises) training program administered in 1 hour, small (up to 10 persons) group-based, supervised sessions twice weekly for 6 weeks.\n\nStudy Outcomes:\n\nDemographic (age, sex, height, weight, and body mass index), comorbidity, attendance, exercise log, and medication use details will be recorded at each visit. Adherence will be measured by exercise program attendance (number of sessions).\nThe following self-report questionnaires will be completed at baseline, 2, and 12 months: the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOAP) Score, and the EuroQOL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Score.\nThe patient knowledge questionnaire on OA (PKQ-OA) and the arthritis self-efficacy questionnaire will be completed at baseline, 2, and 12 months.\nAll participants will complete the 40m Face-Paced Walk Test and the 30s Chair Stand Test at baseline, 2, and 12 months.\nA blood serum sample, collected at baseline, 2, and 12 months will be analyzed to assess for inflammatory biomarkers using a Discovery Assay (42 Custom-Plex human assay) with Luminex-xMAP technology (Eve Technologies).\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS:\n\nDescriptive statistics (mean (95% CI), proportion (95% CI) or median (range) will be used report the baseline, 2, and 12 month change in self-report, functional and biomarker outcomes, as appropriate. To account for the matched design, mean within-pair difference (95% CI) will be used to compare treatment groups across outcomes. Finally, conditional logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between attendance (number of sessions) and 12-month change in each outcome.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE:\n\nThis project will contribute to the understanding of exercise programming prescription for knee OA patients. If GLA:D® and/or JointEffort support improvements in functional mobility, quality of life, pain management, and inflammatory biomarkers, it could play a role in the implementation strategy for OA patients within the province. Exercise programming has the potential to be implemented in several sites across Alberta, and thus potentially modifying disease progression and possibly delaying total joint replacement."

              "BriefSummary":"Seat belts protect people from injuries by diverting crash forces to stronger anatomical structures: the rib cage and the pelvis. Children between the ages of 4 and 8 years are typically not tall enough to wear the seat belt correctly across the chest and hips, and instead wear it on their abdomen and neck. When worn in this way, seat belts direct crash forces to these parts of the body, potentially causing serious damage to internal organs and the spine. For this reason, children of these ages need to use a booster seat; a safety device that prevents seat belt related injuries by raising the child and ensuring the straps are correctly worn across the thorax and hips. In Canada, half of the children who should be using booster seats are prematurely restrained using only the seat belt. The present research project seeks to develop and test a novel intervention to encourage booster seat use.\n\nMany Canadian provinces have enacted laws mandating use, and have developed and implemented evidence-based education programs. Despite these efforts, new approaches to encourage booster seat use are required. In 2010, more than 10 years after booster seats became mandatory, the rate of utilization in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec was still low (25%). Furthermore, recent research indicates that parents' perception of the safety benefit of booster seats is the strongest predictor of use, yet no study to date has tested an education intervention that increases perceived benefit; instead, these interventions focus on teaching guidelines (i.e., minimum and maximum age, height, and weight to determine when a child should use a booster seat, and when it is safe for a child to use only the seat belt).\n\nThe present approach to encouraging booster seat use is novel, because it increases perceived benefit by teaching two principles: (1) seat belts prevent injuries by redirecting crash forces to stronger parts of the body (rib cage and pelvis); and (2), without booster seats, children would wear the seat belt on their abdomen and neck, which directs crash forces to more vulnerable anatomical structures (internal organs and spine). Once parents grasp these two principles, they are expected to better appreciate the safety benefit of booster seats and, thus, be more likely to use them.",
              "DetailedDescription":"The education material currently available in the Transport Canada website will be enhanced, by adding an introduction that describes how seat belts and booster seats work (i.e., these devices help redirect crash forces to stronger parts to the body: rib cage and pelvis).\n\nObjective of the trial: To determine if the enhanced material is better than the current Transport Canada information at increasing perceived safety benefit and intention to use booster seats.\n\nDesign: Concurrent two-group parallel randomized controlled trial.\n\nRandomization: Block randomization will be used to assign participants to either intervention or control groups. Participants and researchers will be blinded to allocation.\n\nParticipants. 303 mothers and 303 fathers of children 4 to 8 years old will be invited to participate, irrespective of whether they use booster seats always, occasionally, or never. A sample of 606 participants provides sufficient power to detect a mean difference in perceived benefit that separates those parents who consistently restrain their child in booster seats from those who do not. Sample size was estimated with the TwoSampleMean function for trials that test superiority of interventions (TrialSize package for R). Participants in the trial will receive $1/each for the completion of the survey. Based on information from studies with similar characteristics, the expected response rate is 40%.\n\nSetting and Procedures. The trial will be conducted entirely online. Participants will be recruited through an online market research firm, Maru/Matchbox, which maintains a nationwide panel of 130,000 individuals whose distribution represents the Canadian population. Maru/Matchbox will send an email invitation to participate along with a link to the online survey. The landing page of the survey will provide description of the study for parents to read. The online survey will be set up in such a way that participants won't be able to start answering questions, unless they consent by clicking the \"I agree\" button. Participants, will be advised to print and keep a copy of the consent form either as PDF or as hard copy. After consenting to participate, the online trial will proceed as follows:\n\nParticipants will complete a baseline questionnaire.\nThe system will randomly assign the participant to either the intervention or the control group. Randomization will be stratified by sex, child age, and jurisdiction to ensure both groups are equal.\nParticipants in the intervention group will be presented the enhanced booster seat material, while participants in the control group will be presented the current Transport Canada booster seat material. Material provided to both groups will be stripped of logos (Transport Canada logos and corporate identity), but will be properly cited.\nParticipants will complete post-intervention questionnaire.\nParticipants in the intervention group will be asked one or two questions to ensure they did not misunderstood the information in an unintended way. If a parent answers incorrectly, the system will clarify the information immediately after.\nParticipants in the control group will be given the option to view the enhanced booster seat material, in order to give them the opportunity to benefit from the intervention."

              "BriefSummary":"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most frequent genetic lipoprotein disorder associated with premature CAD. In Canada, the burden of disease is estimated to be approximately 83,500 patients. The goal of this initiative is to create a registry of subjects with FH across Canada. Rare diseases of lipoprotein metabolism will also be included. Using a \"hub and spoke\" model, the registry will be extended in various communities to link primary care physicians with provincial academic centers. The registry will include clinical, biochemical and demographic information. Specimens (plasma/serum and DNA) will be collected for biobanking. We propose a three-tier registry: local, provincial and Canada-wide, which will be completely anonymized. The registry will be made available for clinicians to manage patient care, identify relatives for screening and treatment (cascade screening), to provide advice to general practitioners and to support collaborative studies in biomedical, clinical, health outcomes and health economics research. The data extracted for the provincial portion of the database will allow administrative database research that will provide important information to key stakeholders and permit allocation of resources. It will also allow a sound and uniform rationale for the use of novel therapeutic agents and provide expert advice to regulatory agencies. At the Canadian level, the database will allow clinicians and researchers to determine the burden of disease and the long-term effects of treatment. Through the creation of a Canada-wide network of academic clinics, integrating lipid specialists, endocrinologists and cardiologists, the Canadian FH registry will lead to significant benefits for FH patients, clinicians and researchers, biopharmaceutical industry and government.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic lipoprotein disorder characterized by elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) >95th percentile for age and gender. Affected individuals may show clinical manifestations (xanthomas, xanthelasmas and premature arcus corneus) although these manifestations are seen less frequently with early diagnosis and treatment. Untreated, FH will lead to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), primarily coronary artery disease (CAD). There are at least three accepted definitions for FH, based on absolute LDL-C levels (MedPed criteria), the Simon-Broome criteria include a fixed cut-point for LDL-C, the presence of DNA mutations and xanthomas and the FH Dutch Criteria (the Netherlands).\n\nThere are well-developed FH Registries in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Spain, France, and the US, through the newly established US FH Foundation. In the United Kingdom, a report on the economic advantages of treating FH revealed that lipid-lowering statin therapy would lead to 101 fewer cardiovascular deaths/1000 patients with FH given treatment. The cost saving from cardiovascular events is estimated at over $CAN 592 million in the UK if all relatives of index cases were identified and treated, compared with no treatment given. This cascade testing strategy has been successfully applied in the Netherlands in families of FH probands with a detected mutation, thus allowing statin treatment of family members at risk of early coronary heart disease.\n\nIn Canada, the burden of disease is estimated to be approximately 83,500 patients, based on an allele frequency of 1/500. In the province of Quebec, the allele frequency is approximately 1/270 and the number of affected subjects is approximately 29,000. Left untreated, FH men develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the third decade of life and women, in the fourth decade. When identified and treated early, life expectancy is normal.\n\nThe purpose of this initiative is to create a registry of subjects with FH across Canada designed to identify subjects with FH and to improve health and healthcare delivery. Rare diseases of lipoprotein metabolism (orphan diseases) will also be included (SMASH registry; Systems and Molecular Approach of Severe Hyperlipidemia). This registry will include clinical, biochemical and demographic information. Specimens (plasma/serum and DNA) will be collected for biobanking. The registry will be made available for clinicians to manage patient care, identify relatives for screening and treatment (cascade screening), to provide advice to general practitioners and to support collaborative studies in biomedical, clinical, health outcomes and health economics research. Access to anonymized data from the registry will be given to researchers, clinicians, biopharmaceutical industry and government by peer-reviewed process.\n\nThe Mission of the Canadian FH Registry is to bring together a multi-disciplinary group of physicians, basic and clinical researchers to improve the delivery of care to patients with severe lipoprotein disorders, especially FH, and to foster collaborative research. Our Vision is to create a Canada-wide network of academic clinics, integrating lipid specialists, endocrinologists and cardiologists to treat patients with the highest standard of care and to create a collaborative research environment. Using a \"hub and spoke\" model, the registry will be extended in various communities to link primary care physicians with provincial academic centers. The Goals are to improve care to patients with FH and to reduce cardiovascular disease in this population at high risk.\n\nGiven the wide geographic distribution of patients with FH, we plan to provide a \"hub and spoke\" model specialized care. The hubs would be based in each province in centers recognized at the national level for their expertise in lipoprotein disorders and with advanced laboratory facilities (medical biochemistry, specialized assays, ultracentrifugation, genetic testing). Radiating from these centers will be clinics that treat patients with FH. We propose a three-tier registry (local, provincial and Canada-wide). The local database would be nominative, used solely by the clinic or center and contain the information obtained by the local investigators and used for clinical purposes. The provincial database will use encrypted numbers, without identifiers other than the provincial health insurance number, and will be used to generate province-specific health outcomes, resource utilization, health economics and comparative epidemiological/genetic/clinical features across provinces. The Canadian database would be anonymous and serve to generate country-wide statistics, public awareness and research collaborations.\n\nAll procedures related to the FH registry will follow uniform standard operation procedures (SOP). The various steps associated with the inclusion of patients within the FH Registry will be the following: subject with high LDL-C, secondary causes ruled out, FH Criteria satisfied, consent form signed, clinical evaluation, baseline lipid profile, demographic info, family history, longitudinal follow-up (annual data capture). If a patient has a family history of FH, then we will start cascade screening. If the FH criteria are not satisfied at the beginning of the study then the patient will be asked to enter in the SMASH registry for other severe disorders of the lipid metabolism.\n\nThe database software should fulfill the following criteria: if must comply with privacy regulations in all provinces, use passwords that allow limited access, with access tailored to each site. It must allow researchers access under strictly controlled conditions after peer-review. The software must be flexible enough to allow easy data entry and capture for the provincial and Canadian databases. Cost considerations are also an issue. The choice of software has not been made yet.\n\nBiobanking will be performed at individual sites, when available. Plasma/serum, DNA, tissues (e.g. skin biopsies) will be potentially included. The consent form will have a specific section dealing with DNA banking and the possibility that the DNA may be sent to a central laboratory for analysis. The informed consent will also stipulate that plasma/serum and DNA samples may be analyzed by academic collaborators outside of Canada and by industry (pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology).\n\nData entry at each site will be performed using nominative information and coded specific to the institution (hospital ID number). In addition, each subject's provincial health insurance number will be entered and a unique identifier will be assigned (for instance BC_000001; QC_000001 and so on). As FH is highly familial by nature, parents, sibs and all first-degree relatives of each subject will also be entered, if known. While each subject will have a distinct identifier, family relationships will be recorded. Completely anonymous data will be made available to researchers, policy makers, governments and industry on a per need basis. Physicians at each site will be able to retrieve the information pertinent to their site only. Access to the database will be granted after investigators have submitted a written request to the Scientific Board and clearance will be given in consultation with the Advisory Board. Both levels of government (provincial and National) will be given similar access, as will the pharmaceutical industry and the biopharmaceutical industry.\n\nPotential benefits Patients. Patients will have access to expert care in the field of lipoprotein disorders and CVD prevention. In many cases, optimal treatment of severe hypercholesterolemia may be best provided by experts in the field. They will have access to on-going clinical trials and to novel therapies. Furthermore, individual patients will be offered family screening to identify affected members who would benefit from early diagnosis and treatment. The identification of new FH cases by cascade screening proves to be both cost-effective and aligns with the aim of providing personalized medicine for patients with severe lipoprotein disorders.\n\nClinicians. The registry will provide the local (i.e. clinic or hospital) framework to diagnose patients according to accepted international criteria for FH, to follow the subjects in time and to perform cascade screening (first, second and third-degree relatives), a cost-effective strategy to screen potentially affected subjects. The registry will also link clinicians into a network of specialized clinics that favor collaborative investigator-initiated research and participation in multi-center studies. The availability of biobanking will allow the storage of plasma/serum and DNA for future research.\n\nBiomedical researchers. The identification of novel genes for FH and other rare lipoprotein disorders has led to a better understanding of metabolic pathways and eventually the potential for novel therapeutic targets. In addition, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions research may shed light on mechanisms of disease. clinical-scientists will have the opportunity to develop investigator-initiated research, using the pan-Canadian registry and biobanking resources as a platform. Researchers in health outcomes and health economics, social, gender and ethnic research will have access to the database in collaboration with provincial administrative databases.\n\nBiopharmaceutical Industry. The biopharmaceutical industry will have access to a group of lipid experts across Canada, with links internationally, a harmonized database for subjects with FH and rare lipoprotein disorders. They will have access to a network of established clinics with a unified database. Access to the registry database will be provided after review of the intended research. This data will be important in determining health economics.\n\nGovernment. This initiative will allow the development of clinical practice guidelines, to determine resource allocation according to need, the identification of rare (orphan disease) lipoprotein disorders requiring specific techniques, such as extracorporeal LDL filtration for homozygous FH. The initiative will allow the framework to set-up collaborative research under the peer-review system (HSFC, CIHR). Health outcomes and health economic studies will allow resource allocation and quality control. Finally centralized genetic testing would provide molecular diagnostics in a cost-effective manner, when required. This initiative will dovetail with the CIHR C-CHANGE initiative concerning the harmonization of cardiovascular preventive guidelines in Canada. To data, we are the only country with harmonized CVD prevention guidelines.\n\nKnowledge translation and training. Individual academic institutions with a strong biomedical research commitment will offer undergraduate and graduate-level training in the field of lipid and lipoproteins within a country-wide collaborative research environment. Several centers will offer post-doctoral fellowships for clinicians and PhDs in lipoprotein metabolism, health outcomes and health economics research. This training of highly qualified personnel is expected to contribute to the academic and economic engine of the country. A formal training course, aligned with the National Lipid Association, will provide certification on the treatment of lipoprotein disorders. The establishment of clinical practice guidelines for adult and pediatric patients will enable clinicians to hone their clinical practice to the highest standard. By using well established conferences across Canada, the aim will be to integrate novel knowledge into the yearly conference programs across Canada and to disseminate this information to practicing physicians and health care professionals."

The workshop is delivered via the Internet over a six-week period. This is a pilot project, which means that it is being run for a limited time to test out its format and its usefulness for participants in Canada. A similar programme has been implemented in the USA, UK, and Australia, but it has to be tried now in Canada to see its usefulness for people in this country. .\n\nThe Online workshop is aimed at helping you to take better care of yourself and to better manage your health condition. It is hoped that at the end of the workshop you will be able to do the things you want to do and maintain the relationships that are important to you.\n\nWith the facilitators and other workshop participants, you will discuss:\n\nDealing with fatigue/tiredness\nDealing with difficult emotions\nDealing with your physical symptoms\nSolving the problems caused by your condition\nStarting and maintaining an appropriate exercise or activity programme\nManaging medications\nCommunicating better with health care professionals\nCommunicating better with your friends, family and colleagues"

The investigators will compare the systolic blood pressure of patients identified to have hypertension in the community that are followed by pharmacists who have undergone the certification course, and compare their blood pressure outcomes to subjects managed by pharmacists who have not yet received the training.",

Through this program, the investigators hope to help with prevention of the costly and chronic conditions to which hypertension often leads, like kidney failure, stroke, and heart disease.\n\nThe HC-PCP aims to provide training to pharmacists in the screening, prevention, and management of hypertension. It has been identified that the development and implementation of this certification program provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of such a program on blood pressure reduction.\n\nThe investigators are aiming to assess the impact of pharmacist management on blood pressure control in patients with hypertension.\n\nThe development of the HC-PCP and the evaluation of its impact will occur in 2 phases. Phase 1 involves the development and implementation of the educational portion of the certification program. Phase 2 involves conducting a 1 year long study to assess the impact of the HC-PCP on blood pressure in patients with poorly controlled hypertension. This will be launched in pharmacies in Alberta."

              "BriefSummary":"The study will consist of three phases: Phase A: General population survey for estimation of the prevalence of asthma, and prospective collection of resource utilization and quality-of-life data for 12 months, Phase B: comparison of healthcare resource usage collected prospectively to the data collected using administrative data in the population recruited in Phase A, and Phase C: Economic modeling of asthma to extrapolate the findings across Canada and into the future years.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Phase A: This phase will be a prospective cohort study of randomly chosen residents of two census subdivisions of BC with a self-reported physician diagnosis of asthma. The study participants will be recruited via landline and cell phone-based random digit dialing across two regions in British Columbia: the Census Sub-Division of the city of Vancouver and the Census Division of Central Okanagan. The target area was chosen based on Census Sub-Division as it provides a clear definition of the target population for whom demographic and socioeconomic data is available through national and provincial census and surveys. The Okanagan Census Sub-Division was particularly chosen as it provides data on both urban and rural populations (18.6% rural population in 2006). According to 2006 census profile, the population of these two Census Sub-Divisions is, respectively, 578,041 and 162,276. Accordingly, about 78% of participants would be recruited from Vancouver, and 22% from Okanagan. The study will randomly sample participants from all the area codes in these regions. The target population will include household residents residing in telephone exchanges within the target Census Sub-Divisions. Random digit dialing will be geographically stratified with an associated sample weight that will approximate a probability sample of the individuals in the population. Previous studies have shown that acceptably high response rates can be achieved among Canadian participants with asthma.\n\nRandom digit dialing samples have been shown to be more representative than population samples drawn using alternative methods such as telephone directories or electronic white pages. However, random digit dialing is not free of bias. Non-random non-response is an issue, and it has been shown that reducing the non-response rate may directly reduce non-response bias. Non-responders in random digit dialing may not have been contacted because the non-responders work multiple minimum-wage jobs. The investigators will place multiple calls and leave messages on answering machines. Random digit dialing is also subject to no-telephone bias - households without telephones are out of reach by random digit dialing, and the households without telephones probably differ in socioeconomic status than the overall population. However, for the urban, suburban, and semi-rural sub-populations within British Columbia, telephone coverage is almost universal.\n\nInclusion of cell phones in random digit dialing is an attempt to mitigate such biases and increase the fraction of population covered by sampling. More importantly, the inclusion of cell phones is likely to result in inclusion of participants that might be absent from landline random digit dialing (younger and more educated groups) thus mitigating the sampling bias of random digit dialing. Cell phone random digit dialing is an active area of research and it is too soon to know with confidence what should and should not be regarded as a \"Best Practice\". For inclusion of cell phones in random digit dialing, the investigators will use the \"Screening Approach\". In this approach the interview is only conducted with participants sampled via the cell phone frame who do not have a landline, thus excluding numbers from the cell phone sample in the overlap (i.e., screening out the participants with both a cell phone and a landline). In this alternative sampling design, participants who have at least one household landline telephone and use at least one cell phone would be eligible for inclusion only from the landline frame. This decreases the bias due to higher probability of sampling from households who have both a landline and cell phone.\n\nThe study will employ the Waksberg method of random digit sampling. In this method, all telephone numbers are initially split into blocks of equal size, called \"primary sampling units\". The primary sampling unit will be a mixture of landlines and cell phones. One randomly selected telephone number is called from each selected primary sampling unit. When a residential connection is reached in the first stage, the primary sampling unit qualifies for inclusion in the second stage.\n\nRespondents will be asked the following question: \"Is there a member of the household between ages of 1 to 85 who has had asthma ever diagnosed by a physician\". If the response is affirmative the study assistant will ask if the participant in question can continue the conversation directly (parents in case of children). Eligible participants (or in the case of children their parents or guardians) will be informed of the objectives of the study, verbally consented, and then screened for eligibility based on age and history of asthma. Participants who meet eligibility criteria and verbally consent over the phone will be asked to come to the study laboratory (one at Vancouver and one at Kelowna, corresponding to the two Census Sub-Divisions) and the participant will receive a detailed explanation of the study and the study consent form at that time.\n\nAll participants who provide signed consent will then proceed to spirometry (simple spirometry without bronchodilator response) and study data collection. After the baseline visit, participants enter a 12-months period of follow-up with visits at months 3, 6, 9, and 12. Participants will be asked to attend one of the study centres and data on the quality of life and asthma-related resource utilization will be gathered. On the final visit, participants will undergo spirometry for objective diagnosis of asthma with possible methacholine challenge test for the participants whose asthma cannot reliability be included or excluded.\n\nPhase B: In this phase of the study, health records of participants who have participated in the phase A of the study for the entire follow-up period and the 12 months period prior to the participants' enrolment will be retrieved from the BC Linked Health Database. In addition, the investigators will identify cases of asthma in the entire British Columbia population based on the administrative data for the same period of time. The BC Linked Health Database is a longitudinal administrative health care database containing participant-specific, anonymized health data from 1985 onwards on British Columbia's 4 million residents with health insurance. Records will be matched based on participants' unique Personal Health number and hence the matching will be almost completely accurate. Data extracted from the BC Linked Health Database will include Medical Services Plan data, which encompass fee-for-service physicians, the Discharge Abstracts Database of hospital inpatient separation records, as well as records of death certificates. Prescription drug use will be determined from the BC Pharmanet database. This is a population-based prescription drug database that captures essentially all dispensing episodes by outpatients residing in the province on a prescription-by-prescription basis (regardless of funding source)..\n\nOne request thought the British Columbia ministry of health (personal communication with Data Stewardship Secretariat) is required to retrieve data on the study participants as well as cases of asthma across the entire province, without additional cost for the latter group. The investigators will use this opportunity to retrieve data on cases of asthma in the entire province and compare different aspects of resource utilization between objectively verified cases of asthma and the data retrieved using a case definition algorithm on an administrative database. Such data will be used to retrospectively estimate the direct costs of asthma during the follow-up and in the 12 months prior to the enrolment in the study. The direct medical costs calculated in this way will be compared with the direct costs calculated in the prospective phase of the study. In addition, the investigators will examine the representativeness of the sample population by comparing the participant's health records with case of asthma in British Columbia identified through the BC Linked Health Database. Given the objective validation of the diagnosis of asthma at the end of the follow-up period in Phase A, the investigators will also be able to explore the sensitivity of existing case ascertainment algorithms based on administrative data at levels of severity and control.\n\nPhase C: Economic model of asthma: The data collected from participants during this study will be extrapolated to the population of British Columbia and Canada by appropriate adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic differences and reported prevalence of asthma in the country. The data will also be used to populate a Markov model of asthma to project the burden of asthma for the next 10 years. The Markov model of asthma will extend the model previously developed by Price et al. However, the investigators will model all 4 states of severity as defined by the Global Initiative in Asthma and whether at each year the participant's symptoms are controlled or uncontrolled. The Markov model will hence consist of 8 states (plus state of death) for all permutations of levels of severity and control. The model will also incorporate both the steady-state of chronic asthma and the acute state associated with an asthma exacerbation. Whenever possible, the investigators will estimate the parameters of the model from the cohort of participants in the Phase A and B of the study. This will include the initial distribution of individuals according to levels of severity and control, and the quality of life weights and annual direct and indirect costs estimated from the statistical analysis of the cohort data. The long term transition probabilities among levels of severity and control cannot reliably be estimated given the short follow-up of the participants in this study. The investigators will use values estimated from the literature for these and other components of the model."

              "BriefSummary":"Type 2 diabetes can be prevented by lifestyle changes in high-risk subjects. However, controversies exist on nutritional management of diabetes. Recent data suggests that glucose and insulin responses are affected by not only the quality, but the quantity of carbohydrate consumed. This is referred to as glycemic load.\n\nTo date, there have not been any prospective randomized studies which examine the utility of a low glycemic load diet.\n\nThe purpose of the proposed study is to compare the effectiveness of a Canada Food Guide Diet with a low glycemic load diet on blood sugar control in overweight type 2 diabetics.",
              "DetailedDescription":"The primary objective of the proposed study is to compare the effectiveness of a low glycemic load diet with a Canada Food Guide Diet on weight loss in overweight subjects with cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe secondary objective of the proposed study is to compare the effectiveness of a low glycemic load diet with both a low glycemic index diet and a low carbohydrate diet on weight loss in overweight subjects with cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this portion of the study is to try to elucidate the relative contributions of the glycemic index and carbohydrate content to the overall effectiveness of a low glycemic load diet. Furthermore, through detailed analysis of actual dietary consumption, and correlation with subsequent weight loss, we hope to gain greater insight into the role of compliance on the success of the various dietary strategies. Restriction of caloric intake is necessary for weight loss regardless of the dietary strategy employed, however, long-term success depends ultimately on the ability of the patients to comply with the said diet. The success of a low glycemic load diet may lie in its superior effectiveness (greater compliance, less calorie consumption) rather than a greater efficacy per se.\n\nA secondary analysis of the effects of all three diets (low glycemic load, low glycemic index and low carbohydrate) on modifying other metabolic factors will also be performed. In particular, the study will examine the effect of the three diets on lipid and fat metabolism, insulin resistance and inflammation."

              "BriefSummary":"Many people worldwide received the monovalent adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine. However, very little is known about the safety of the vaccine, particularly beyond the first few weeks after vaccination. This study will combine data from a well-established immunization registry in Manitoba with data from hospitalization and physician records, to examine the safety of the vaccine in the six month period post-vaccination. Studies on vaccine safety are important as the public's perception of the safety of a vaccine has a major role in its uptake.",
              "DetailedDescription":"The objective of this study is to examine the safety of the H1N1 vaccine administered in Manitoba during the second wave of the pandemic (Oct 2009-Mar 2010) by describing the age sex specific and age standardized incidence rates of certain vaccination adverse events in the vaccinated populations during the first 6 months of follow-up and to compare the rates with those in the non-vaccinated population and the general Manitoba population.\n\nStudy design The proposed study will be a retrospective analysis of population based cohorts of subjects whose vaccination status and health events before and after H1N1 vaccination are recorded in various Manitoba databases. All H1N1 vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals are eligible to be included in the study population. There will be no exclusion criteria. The list of specific adverse events of special interest (AESIs) includes: anaphylaxis, Bell's palsy, convulsions, demyelination, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuritis, vasculitis and various pregnancy outcomes.\n\nVaccinated individuals will be identified using the Manitoba Immunization Monitoring System (MIMS). Unvaccinated individuals will be identified using the Population Registry. AESIs and other clinically relevant information will be determined using hospital, physician claim and DPIN databases.\n\nThe primary statistical analysis will be a comparison of the overall and age specific rates of deaths and AESIs in the vaccinated cohort relative to the non-vaccinated cohort. The two cohorts will be matched on age (month and year of birth), sex and postal code of residence. The analyses will be stratified by specific subgroups: (e.g. pregnant women, persons who are immune suppressed or with autoimmune disorders).\n\nThe observed number of events will be determined from the date of first vaccination for each subject and the matched control until the first occurrence of a specific event. Information on events for each person will be derived from the medical claims and hospitalization databases. The person years at risk will be calculated from the date of first vaccination until the first occurrence of the specific event, emigration from Manitoba, or until 6 months after vaccination. Incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated by comparing the standardized incidence rates in the vaccinated cohort with those in the matched non vaccinated cohort.\n\nIn addition, the observed number of deaths and AESIs in the total vaccinated population and in specific subgroups (as above) will be compared to the expected numbers based on the age sex specific rates in the general Manitoba population. Similar to the matched cohort component, the observed number of events will be determined for the vaccinated individuals from the date of first vaccination until the first occurrence of a specific event, and the person years at risk will be calculated from the date of first vaccination until the first occurrence of the specific event, emigration from Manitoba, or until 6 months after vaccination. The background rate of targeted events will be calculated utilizing information from the mortality, physician claims and hospitalization databases for the total population in Manitoba for the period 2004 2008. Since the risk of some of the events is low, calculating the age sex specific rates based on five years of data will increase the stability of the rates. The expected number of events will be calculated by multiplying the person years at risk by the age sex specific background rate of each targeted event. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) or mortality ratios (SMRs) will be calculated as the number of observed events over the number of expected events, with 95% confidence intervals. To assess the absolute burden of an eventual excess in observed number of events the absolute difference between the observed and expected number of events for certain AESIs will also be calculated."

Multivariate models are used to assess the effects of influenza type on clinical outcomes while accounting for potential confounders.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Annual epidemics of influenza are an important public health problem globally and in Canada. Each year, 10-25% of the Canadian population become infected with influenza. Most of these infections are typically asymptomatic or associated with a mild self-limiting illness. However, influenza can cause severe illness leading to hospitalization and death, especially among the very young, the elderly and among those with underlying chronic conditions. It has been estimated that on average about 4,000 influenza-related deaths occur in Canada each year. In addition, the economic burden of influenza is significant because of the high direct costs associated with increased utilization of services and the indirect costs caused by school and work absenteeism.\n\nThis project compares laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A and B in terms of their epidemiology, and the overall and cause-specific incidence rates of important clinical outcomes including physician visits, hospitalization and death following clinical diagnosis of influenza cases in Manitoba over the period from 1993 to 2008.\n\nThe study assesses secular and seasonal trends in the incidence rates of influenza A and B cases in Manitoba during the period of 1993-2008, to determine whether these rates vary for different subsets of the population defined by demographic (e.g., age group, gender), socioeconomic, geographic (neighborhood of residence) and clinical (e.g., vaccination, presence of chronic conditions, immune status) characteristics.\n\nThe analysis by influenza type then compares the overall and cause-specific incidence rates of physician visits, hospitalization and death following the diagnosis of a laboratory-confirmed influenza. The effects of influenza type on clinical outcomes (e.g., hospitalization) are assessed with multivariate models while accounting for potential confounding by demographic, socioeconomic, geographic and clinical (e.g., co-morbidity, immune status) characteristics."

The energy is delivered via a proprietary catheter through the bronchoscope.\n\nTwo sessions of treatment will be delivered one month apart. The right lung is treated at the first treatment session and the left lung is treated at the second treatment session (approximately one month after the right side is treated). Treatment will be delivered by a respiratory physician (interventional pulmonologist) in a tertiary teaching hospital during a bronchoscopic procedure. The bronchoscopy will be delivered during general anaesthesia. It is anticipated that the bronchoscopic procedure will last less than 60 minutes in total. Treatment will be deemed to have been delivered following the successful treatment during the two bronchoscopies.\n\nA third bronchoscopy will be performed three months following the second treatment session where treatment is not delivered but a cryo-biopsy will be taken from the airway sites that have been treated during the two previous bronchoscopic treatment session to evaluate the effect of the treatment on the airways producing excessive mucous.\n\nSubjects will be required to submit to several tests during the study including two CT scans (lung), respiratory function tests, exercise testing."

              "BriefSummary":"Excellent immune responses following 1 or 2 doses of the GSK monovalent AS03-adjuvanted pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) vaccines (e.g., Arepanrix®) have been documented in several trials. Observational studies have found that these vaccines were effective in preventing laboratory confirmed influenza infections. However, it remains unclear whether vaccination during the pandemic was associated with reductions in more clinically meaningful outcomes, such as hospitalizations, severe illness, complications, and death.\n\nThe investigators propose to evaluate the effectiveness of the GSK adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccines used in Manitoba in preventing hospitalization and severe illness (defined as illness necessitating admission to intensive care or associated with major complications) due to influenza or pneumonia by means of a case-control study using data from Manitoba Health (MH) administrative databases and the database of the Cadham Provincial Laboratory. The primary outcome will be hospitalization with laboratory-confirmed influenza or pneumonia. A secondary outcome will be hospitalization with influenza or pneumonia. The investigators will also assess the effectiveness of the above vaccines for different age groups and among high-risk populations, e.g., immunocompromised individuals.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Testing for influenza is largely discretionary because most patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) could be effectively and safely managed even when the diagnosis is not confirmed. So, it is unclear whether reduction in the risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza or mild ILI among vaccinated individuals is of much clinical significance. In contrast, hospitalization due to influenza or pneumonia is usually not as discretionary, and from both clinical and public health perspectives avoiding hospitalization is more important and relevant objective for influenza control than the mere reduction of laboratory-confirmed cases.\n\nThus far there have been few observational studies that examined the effectiveness of the H1N1 vaccine against hospitalization, and most of them had significant limitations including small sample sizes, information limited to certain age groups (e.g., children) and the potential for selection and recall bias. Using data from a Scottish general practice sentinel surveillance network, Simpson et al reported that the adjuvanted GSK vaccine was 95% (76-100%) effective against laboratory-confirmed H1N1 infections, and 100% (∞-100%) effective against hospitalization for influenza and pneumonia. Unexpectedly, the vaccine was equally effective among 'high-risk' groups. Small number of cases limited the precision of these estimates; the above-mentioned estimate for vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization is based on a one case only, which is the reason for the wide confidence interval that is compatible with any VE estimate (∞-100%). A hospital-based case-control study from Spain showed that use of several pandemic vaccines was associated with 90% effectiveness in preventing laboratory-confirmed H1N1 infections among hospitalized patients. That study was not population-based and was limited by small number of fully-vaccinated subjects (only 7 subjects received a pandemic vaccine ≥ 7 days before symptom onset).\n\nTwo Canadian studies examined the effectiveness of the GSK adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine: one was very small (28 cases) and was limited to children under 10 years. The study by Skowronski et al. that used data from the Canadian VE sentinel network did not examine VE against hospitalization and it, too, was very small.\n\nIn the Canadian province of Manitoba, mass immunization against pandemic H1N1 commenced October 26th 2010 using primarily large scale vaccination clinics led by public health teams and lasted approximately 8 weeks. Initially, the Canadian-manufactured Arepanrix®, an AS03-adjuvanted split virion pandemic H1N1 vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline [GSK]), was used to vaccinate adults and children over 6 months of age. Later on, two nonadjuvanted vaccines, from CSL Limited and GSK, were offered to pregnant women and children over 10 years of age. The seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV)-Fluviral® (GSK) and Vaxigrip® (Sanofi Pasteur) - were less frequently administered.\n\nAll vaccines were offered free of charge, but limited vaccine supply at campaign start necessitated the development of priority groups for early vaccination. The initial priority group in Manitoba included health care workers, Aboriginal persons, pregnant women, 6-60 months-old children, individuals under 65 years with chronic medical conditions, immunocompromised individuals and residents of remote communities. On November 18,2010, the pandemic H1N1 vaccines were made available to the whole population.\n\nThis study evaluates the effectiveness of the GSK adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccines used in Manitoba in preventing hospitalization and severe illness. The advantages of the proposed study over the existing literature are related to the availability of high-quality population-based health administrative databases that cover a well-defined population. The whole population of Manitoba is eligible and available for inclusion in the study, so selection bias is not a concern. Ascertainment of cases is virtually complete because all admitted influenza or pneumonia cases in the province are captured by the Hospital Abstract database. The availability of detailed histories of vaccination, through the unique Manitoba Immunization Registry eliminates recall bias, reduces vaccine use measurement errors (e.g., due to patient confusion about what vaccines were received) and permits detailed assessments of the effect of the timing of vaccination on the risk of hospitalization. These detailed analyses will be facilitated by the large sample size (40% of Manitoba's 1.2 million population were vaccinated)."

              "BriefSummary":"For the majority of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), treatment with Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) provides high initial procedural success. However, the medium to long-term complications range from rather immediate elastic recoil or vessel contraction to longer processes like smooth muscle cell proliferation and excessive production of extra cellular matrix, thrombus formation and atherosclerotic changes like restenosis or angiographic re-narrowing. The reported incidence of restenosis after PTCA ranges from 30%-50%. Such rates of recurrence have serious economic consequences. Bare Metal Stents (BMS), designed to address the limitations of PTCA, reduced the angiographic and clinical restenosis rates in de novo lesions compared to PTCA alone and decreased the need for CABG. BMS substantially reduced the incidence of abrupt artery closure, but restenosis still occurred in about 20%-40% of cases, necessitating repeat procedures. The invention of Drug Eluting Stents (DES) significantly improved on the principle of BMS by adding an antiproliferative drug (directly immobilized on the stent surface or released from a polymer matrix), which inhibits neointimal hyperplasia. The introduction of DES greatly reduced the incidence of restenosis and resulted in a better safety profile as compared to BMS with systemic drug administration. These advantages and a lower cost compared to surgical interventions has made DES an attractive option to treat coronary artery disease. This observational registry is designed to investigate and collect clinical evidence for the clinical performance and safety of the Orsiro Drug Eluting Stent System in an all-comers patient population in daily clinical practice."

              "BriefSummary":"Computer-based Training for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT4CBT) is a new on-line addiction treatment developed by Dr Kathleen Carroll at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. CBT4CBT consists of seven one-hour long online sessions that teach key concepts, including dealing with cravings, problem solving, and decision making skills, to help users reduce substance abuse. CBT4CBT has been rigorously tested throughout various communities in the United States with great success and is currently being rolled out throughout the States. The therapeutic approach of CBT4CBT is unique as its efficacy, durability and cost-savings have been proven in several rigorous clinical trials and will be magnified by the fact that the program can be delivered in Canada, allowing for increased and continual improvements in population health. CBT4CBT has been accepted by both patients and addiction treatment personnel alike and has won numerous clinical innovation awards.\n\nA collaboration has now been formed between Dr Carroll and Drs Michelle Patterson and Juergen Krause of the UPEI Centre for Health and Community Research (CHCR) that will bring CBT4CBT to Canada. While CBT4CBT has previously been tested in urban areas, there are many advantages to offering computer-based training to more rural populations (such as PEI). These more remote areas frequently suffer from a lack of services, as well as a lack of continuity with the services currently offered. CBT4CBT may very well provide that needed continuity to Addictions treatment and has also been shown to improve retention.",
              "DetailedDescription":"CBT4CBT will be the first computer-based, cognitive behavioural therapy program for Addictions treatment to be offered in Canada. CBT4CBT has been rigorously tested in urban populations in the United States but this collaboration will be the first pilot trial in First Nation and other rural communities in Canada. Prince Edward Island has a self-proclaimed need for innovative new substance abuse treatments and CBT4CBT may provide the continuity and retention to traditional therapy programs that current available treatment options often lack. This study will allow CBT4CBT to be tested in several Prince Edward Island communities to gage its efficacy and effectiveness. The results and feedback received from the pilot study will allow the program to be adapted for Canadian populations in order to optimize its positive outcomes within Canada.\n\nCBT4CBT has been tested in urban populations in the United States in three rigorous randomized clinical trials with great success. The nature of CBT4CBT suggests it would also be beneficial in rural and remote populations which are common across Canada. Computer based treatments are cost-effective and although their nature necessitates human participants they have minimal risk associated with them. As the first computer based training for Addictions in Canada this research project could have broad implications for treatment in Addictions across our country.\n\nAnalysis techniques will be based on those used in previous CBT4CBT trials conducted by our collaborator, Dr Carroll.\n\nThe primary substance abuse outcomes (self-reported abstinence) will be assessed throughout the study and through a six month follow-up. Additional outcomes will include use of other services (medical, legal), patient and provider satisfaction, as well as the costs of implementing the program. Each week, the counsellors will deliver a questionnaire (provided by the CHCR) which covers this range of topics to their patient participating in the trial. The data will be analyzed with a focus on feasibility (retention in both conditions, levels of substance abuse, health problems, and cost by condition)."

              "BriefSummary":"Delirium is a prevalent complication following cardiac surgery that is under-recognized using current methods of delirium detection and that may be better identified through a systematic and standardized perioperative screening protocol.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of postoperative delirium in the current era of cardiac surgery using a validated delirium-screening tool.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Delirium is an acute confusional state characterized by fluctuating mental status, inattention, and either disorganized thinking or altered level of consciousness. It has long been recognized as a complication of cardiac surgery, a condition more likely to be experienced among elderly patients and those with greater comorbid disease burden. In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the negative effect of delirium on post-operative outcomes, including long-term survival, freedom from hospital readmission and reduced cognitive and functional recovery. Despite this, little is still known about the true incidence of delirium following cardiac surgery, with published rates of delirium post-cardiac surgery ranging widely from 3% - 78%.\n\nFrom September 1, 2014 to November 30, 2014, ALL patients undergoing cardiac surgery at each of the participating centers will be screened for post-operative delirium. Patients will NOT be excluded on the basis of urgency or procedure type. Delirium screening will be conducted for either up to 7 days following their date of surgery or up until their date of initial discharge from the intensive care unit, whichever comes first. Each center will be allowed to employ the delirium-screening tool currently in use at their institution provided that the tool is either the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) or Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). It is intended that either ICDSC or CAM-ICU, paired with a Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) or the Riker Sedation and Agitation Scale (SAS) be administered once per shift (i.e. with first assessment in the morning and a second assessment with the beginning of the evening shift). In addition, data regarding baseline demographic and clinical characteristics will be collected as well as data regarding the procedure performed (see Case Report Form (CRF). Patients will be considered as having had post-operative delirium if the results of at least one of the screening tests administered yielded a positive finding of delirium. In addition to reporting an overall rate of delirium, unadjusted and adjusted incidence rates of delirium will be reported by institution and for the entire cohort. Risk-adjustment will be performed using multivariate regression modeling techniques.\n\nThis study will be the first to report on incidence rates of delirium following cardiac surgery across multiple centers employing standardized screening methodologies. The results of this study will provide valuable insight into the true burden of delirium among patients having undergone a cardiac surgical procedure in the current era. This is the first step in creating a multifaceted delirium prevention/treatment clinical pathway for the cardiac surgery patient."

              "BriefSummary":"(1) Due to missed childhood vaccination programs, the majority of adult patients with NAFLD in Canada do not have immunity to hepatitis B. (2) Adults with NAFLD who receive the HBV vaccine have reduced immunogenic responses in the setting of obesity (i.e., protective anti-HBs titres). Aims: (1) To determine the sero-prevalence of immunity against hepatitis B in a cohort of prospectively evaluated adult NAFLD patients. (2) To prospectively determine HBV vaccine responses (anti-HBs titres) in adult NAFLD patients.",
              "DetailedDescription":"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is truly a global human pathogen that affects at least 2 billion people worldwide including ~240 million chronic hepatitis B (CHB) carriers that are at risk for end-stage liver disease. The diagnosis of CHB is confirmed by the persistence of the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) in serum for >6 months. However, a latent form of HBV infection known as occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) characterized by low-level viremia (i.e., HBV DNA < 200 IU/ml) despite undetectable serum HBsAg has been described with unclear clinical consequences.\n\nA safe and effective HBV vaccine has been available for ~3 decades and consists of recombinant HBsAg which contains the major viral antigenic epitopes and induces a protective neutralizing antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) response in >85% of children vaccinated. Canada is a low HBV-endemic region and in Alberta, and Ontario, public health uses maternal screening for HBsAg to identify babies at-risk for CHB. Thus, all infants born to HBsAg (+) mothers are given passive-active immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and the HBV vaccine within 12 hours of birth, as well as 2 doses at ~2 and ~6 months of age. Testing of the infants for anti-HBs is recommended at 9 months to ensure immunity. In the late 1990's, a universal HBV childhood vaccination program was initiated in all Canadian provinces and jurisdictions. In Alberta and in Ontario, school-age children are scheduled to receive the 3-dose HBV vaccine series in grade 5. However there remain a significant proportion of adult Canadians (i.e., born before 1985) who missed childhood vaccination programs. Although current guidelines recommend that certain high-risk populations receive hepatitis B immunization, appropriate identification and compliance is generally much lower in adults compared to children.\n\nAccording to the most recent Canadian Association for the Study of Liver Disease guidelines, all adults with diabetes, as well as all patients with chronic liver disease should receive the hepatitis B vaccine. The basis for these recommendations are two-fold, (1) diabetics may be at risk of blood-borne virus (BBV) exposure through contact with contaminated blood glucose monitoring devices and (2) diabetic patients are at increased risk of the metabolic syndrome and the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The improvement in blood glucose monitoring devices, and increased knowledge has reduced the risk of HBV exposure in patients with diabetes. Further, the investigators' initial seroepidemiological survey of acute HBV outbreaks in Alberta revealed a decreasing prevalence in diabetic patients. Therefore the main incentive for HBV vaccination in diabetics is due to the concomitant risk of the metabolic syndrome and advanced liver disease due to NAFLD. There is limited data on HBV vaccination in NAFLD patients. Further studies are required in a North American adult (Canadian population).\n\nThe investigators propose that adults with NAFLD should undergo comprehensive screening for hepatitis B immunogenicity, in addition to screening for infection, and catch up or booster vaccinations should be administered to non-immunized patients with confirmatory immunity testing thereafter."

              "BriefSummary":"The Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program (CPNP) aims to improve birth outcomes among Canadian women in challenging life circumstances, including those who are adolescents, newcomers, low-income or single mothers. The CPNP strongly promotes breastfeeding prenatally, resulting in high initiation rates, but continued postnatal support is needed to optimize breastfeeding duration and exclusivity.\n\nThe aim of this research is to investigate the effects of adding postnatal lactation support as an extension to the CPNP on breastfeeding duration and exclusivity in the first six months postpartum. The research will be conducted at two CPNP sites in Toronto, Parkdale Queen West Community Health Centre and The Stop Community Food Centre. A quasi-experimental design will be used to compare the infant feeding practices of CPNP clients before and after introduction of a postnatal lactation support intervention which will include in-home professional lactation support and provision of high-quality breast pumps. These services will be delivered as CPNP program components and will be accessible to all clients at the two participating sites during the post-intervention period. Infant feeding practices will be assessed by a questionnaire administered at 2 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 months postpartum. The hypothesis is that significantly more mothers in the post-intervention group will be exclusively breastfeeding at four months postpartum. The effect is expected to be mediated through increased breastfeeding self-efficacy, which will be assessed using validated scales prenatally and at 2 weeks and 2 months postpartum."

BDI was measured at day 1 prior to the first dose with domain scores ranging from 0=very severe to 4=no impairment and a total score ranging from 0 to 12(best). TDI captures changes from baseline. Each domain is scored from -3=major deterioration to 3=major improvement to give an overall TDI focal score of -9 to 9. Higher numbers indicate a better score.

Vancouver, Canada) versus interrupted technique using 0 non-barbed delayed absorbable suture (PDS II™, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA).\n\n1.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVE - To compare robotic assisted laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy anatomic failure rates at 6 months post-operative follow-up using self-anchoring 1 barbed delayed absorbable suture (Quill™ SRS, Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Vancouver, Canada) versus 0 non-barbed delayed absorbable suture (PDS II™, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA). The investigators will also assess mesh erosion rates, costs, and surgeon satisfaction rates.\n\n2.0 HYPOTHESIS 2.1 Primary: 2.1.a. Attachment of mesh using the running technique with self-anchoring 1 barbed delayed absorbable suture (Quill™ SRS, Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Vancouver, Canada) will be faster than the standard fixation interrupted technique using 0 non-barbed delayed absorbable suture (PDS II™, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA).\n\n2.2 Secondary: 2.2.a. Attachment of mesh using the running technique with self-anchoring 1 barbed delayed absorbable suture (Quill™ SRS, Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Vancouver, Canada) will be less costly than the standard fixation interrupted technique using 0 non-barbed delayed absorbable suture (PDS II™, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA).\n\n2.2.b. Failure rates and mesh erosion rates for each technique will be equally low.\n\n2.2.c. Surgeons will prefer the barbed running technique over the interrupted technique based on subjective surgeon satisfaction questionnaires."

              "BriefSummary":"There is global recognition in clinical guidelines and governing bodies that low back pain (LBP) should be managed with a biopsychosocial approach. Despite this, research indicates that physiotherapists, who treat the majority of LBP patients in the community, do not feel confident in using this treatment approach. Previous work to support implementation in this field has resulted in low uptake and has highlighted several barriers to implementation, including the need for additional ongoing support. The use of a local champion to support implementation has been successful in other fields and thus, represents a viable strategy to explore. Before undertaking a fully powered trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a champion for implementation, a pilot study is being conducted to determine the feasibility of the intervention as well as determining the feasibility of using a cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate it.\n\nIn this study, a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial design will be used with an embedded qualitative interview study. Physiotherapists will be recruited who manage LBP in any publicly funded physiotherapy departments within Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Individual sites will be grouped into clusters based on their number of full-time physiotherapists, geography, and organisational relationships. All participants will be asked to complete a previously developed online training course to upskill them to deliver a biopsychosocial evidence-based intervention for LBP. Clusters randomised to receive a local champion will receive additional support from their champion. A basic champion training package has been developed based on known barriers in the literature. This will be tailored by co-developing aspects with study champions based on a comprehensive assessment of perceived implementation barriers using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour (COM-B) model. A range of physiotherapist-level outcomes pre-post training will be measured and implementation of the evidence based biopsychosocial intervention will be monitored during a 6-month period after completion of the online training. After this 6-month period, a purposive sample of physiotherapists from each cluster who had both implemented and failed to implement the biopsychosocial intervention will be interviewed."

              "BriefSummary":"Stigma related to chronic disease is rejection or judgement or exclusion by others that is related to the chronic disease itself and is unwarranted. We are trying to figure out what proportion of young people with type 1 diabetes experience stigma in Canada. By young people, we mean teenagers and young adults; specifically, people who are between 14 and 25 years of age. This is a challenging period in life when identities are developed and peer opinions are felt to be particularly important. Experiencing stigma in this life period may be especially hurtful and may have bad effects on taking care of type 1 diabetes. This may lead to important medical problems like dangerously low or high blood sugar values. By understanding how common stigma is, we can figure out the need for programs and strategies to deal with it.\n\nWe will ask young people with type 1 diabetes to help us study this problem by completing an online survey. We will 'advertise' our study through type 1 diabetes clinics, websites, and social media. People who are eligible and interested will click on an internet link and be directed to the survey. Staff at clinics in Montreal, Calgary, and Vancouver will also draw their attention to the posters and/or provide small flyers with the internet link for the study.\n\nParticipants will be asked about their general sense of well-being, their habits and behaviours, and their blood sugar control, including frequency of both lows and highs. They will also be asked if they are willing to mail in a small blood sample. If yes, they will receive a kit with a small lancing device and instructions on how to clean their finger tip, prick it, and express a few drops of blood into a small container. They will then mail this back to us in a postage-paid envelope. We will use this to measure their hemoglobin A1c, an overall measure of blood sugar control.\n\nWe will use this information to (1) calculate the proportion of young people with type 1 diabetes who experience stigma; (2) figure out what factors and behaviours might predict or signal the experience of stigma; (3) see if there is a link between stigma and A1c control and/or frequent lows by report; (4) explore challenges and solutions voiced through the open-ended questions.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Stigma in diabetes has been understudied. Some recent investigations have examined stigma in adults with type 1 diabetes through in-depth interviews. Such qualitative evaluations provide important insights into the roots and experiences of stigma, but cannot capture the prevalence of the problem. This is a key gap that we will address through a national sample. We will also assess the relationship of stigma to both glycemic control and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as mood, self-efficacy, and sense of well-being. PROs are increasingly recognized as critical outcome measures. Finally, we will explore potential solutions with participants.\n\nMethods\n\nSelection of questions to capture stigma: As a starting point, we will consider the questions included by Mulvaney and colleagues in their validated Barriers to diabetes adherence in adolescents questionnaire. This 21-item tool includes 6 questions on stigma and 4 other components (stress and burnout, time pressure and planning, social support, parental autonomy support) and showed good overall internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.88). We will also consider additional questions proposed by our team, related to lived experiences with type 1 diabetes and to managing young people with type 1 diabetes (e.g., stigma within social media networks).\n\nCreation of on-line questionnaire Based on (1), we will create an online questionnaire through FluidSurveys™ (www.fluidsurveys.com). Participants will be able to fill the survey directly online or offline on tablets, laptops or cell phones. The survey platform also allows participants to upload documents (pictures, videos, text). The questionnaires will be available in both French and English and will include close-ended and open-ended questions. Participants will be allowed to interrupt survey completion as needed and continue at a later time, as convenient.\n\nIn addition to stigma, we will query peer support, quality of life and well-being, diabetes history and current treatment, and socio-demographic information.Overall well-being will be assessed with the WHO-5 well being index, a validated 5-item questionnaire. It is the most widely used questionnaires assessing subjective psychological well-being and has been used in people with type 1 diabetes. Demographic factors including age, sex, and ethnocultural background will be queried to ascertain if the prevalence of diabetes-related stigma is more common in some demographic subgroups (e.g., teens vs. young adults, females vs. males, ethnocultural groups). Similarly, we will query sexual orientation/gender identification in order to ascertain, for example, if being LGBT (i.e., Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender), or subgroups thereof, is associated with higher prevalence of diabetes-related stigma. Owing to their potentially sensitive nature, however, the questions on sexual orientation/gender orientation will be explicitly optional\n\nFollowing completion of close-ended questions, participants will respond to open-ended questions that seek to capture experiences and perceptions of stigma as well ideas as to how stigma may be effectively addressed. They will be permitted to upload explanatory materials (e.g., videos, testimonials, pictures, drawings).\n\nFollowing survey completion, participants will receive a kit for A1c testing (DTILaboratories, Inc.) with a pre-paid envelope for mailing the sample back to Montreal. The kit includes a sample vial that contains EDTA preservative, a vial holder, a single use lancet, a capillary tube device to draw up a small amount of blood after lancing, and a Ziploc bag. Participants will receive instructions to place the vial on the vial holder, wash their hands, lance a finger tip (they are familiar with this, as type 1 diabetes patients), draw up the blood with the capillary tube, and then release the blood into the vial. The instructions include pictures. They will then place the vial into the Ziploc bag, then into the prelabelled and postage paid box, and then mail the package through a Canada Post mail box. The samples are stable for 2.5 months without refrigeration. The AccuBase A1c Test Kit is a non-fasting, finger stick, whole blood mail-in test requiring a very small blood volume (0.001ml). Samples are stable for 45 days un-refrigerated once collected. They are analysed using a two step process. The screening step detects hemoglobin variants and/or disturbed erythrocyte kinetics by ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The second step includes the use of an interference-free procedure HPLC-boronate affinity, that provides a hemoglobin A1c value free of possible interferences including chemically modified derivatives. It is considered one of the most accurate and comprehensive A1c tests available.\n\nRecruitment Adolescents and emerging adults with type 1 diabetes aged ≥ 14 and < 25 years will be recruited. The study will be publicized through Facebook©, Twitter© , and other forms of social media as well as websites of organizations such as Canadian Diabetes Association, Juvenil Diabetes Research Foundation, Diabète Québec and the Quebec Diabetic Children's Foundation. These organizations may be asked to mail out flyers or send email messages through any patient contacts. Specifically, the study will be publicized through posters at diabetes clinics, Facebook© pages and websites of diabetes organizations and messages on Twitter©. As in previous studies, we will include a description of the STIGMA study with a link on the websites of diabetes organizations. We will also ask the organizations to contact their members directly to inform them about the study, with a link embedded in the email message."

              "BriefSummary":"In the present study, ulcerative colitis (UC) patients in the remission stage of the disease will be randomized into two groups: Alberta anti-inflammatory diet and Canada's Food Guide diet. The elements of Alberta anti-inflammatory diet have previously been shown to have a role in decreasing the risk of UC development or management of UC-related symptoms or relapse. Since the primary outcome of interest is the relapse rate in two groups, disease status will be assessed monthly using appropriate tools. In order to find out the underlying mechanisms that will relate the proposed diet to decreased flare rate, some laboratory evaluations, which are mainly markers of inflammation or are related to gut microbiome will be conducted. In the present study, the investigators will also perform state-of-the art metabolomics tests, in order to study how the dietary changes will change the end metabolites. In addition, the investigators will be able to explore if metabolomic profile of participants can predict future UC relapse. This study will last for 6 months from baseline wherein all the study subjects will receive appropriate dietary instructions in addition to their stable doses of maintenance drug therapy.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Recent research suggests that habitual dietary may play an important part in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but this has not been systematically explored. Habitual intake of a diet that is rich in \"anti-inflammatory\" nutrients (e.g. n-3 fatty acids, polyphenols), soluble fiber and other prebiotics (e.g. inulin), and probiotics (that improve gut microbiota) may lead to major improvements in IBD disease. Ultimately, the investigators are interested in studying the extent to which habitually eating foods, sources of these important nutrients and dietary components, might help people with IBD living in Alberta. Thus, the information about nutrients and dietary components must be translated to foods and dietary patterns that are acceptable and accessible to people in Alberta. This study will compare the effectiveness of 2 different approaches, either a structured, personalized menu plan constructed with a dietitian (intervention group) vs. general advice to follow Canada's Food Guide by a dietitian (control group), to promoting uptake and adherence to an appropriate diet. The control group will receive the same care as the intervention group as far as access to a registered dietitian. In the intervention group, the nutritional advice offered will be to follow a structured four-week menu plan that includes recipes and nutrition tips. The menu plan emphasizes specific foods that have been shown in the literature to improve IBD symptoms. In the control group, the nutritional advice will be general and will emphasize the principles outlined in Canada's Food Guide. Each control participant will be provided with their daily serving size allowance for each of the four food groups. Each participant will have sole responsibility in deciding which foods are selected from each food group; specific foods will not be highlighted.\n\nObjectives: To evaluate if the proposed Alberta anti-inflammatory diet is effective for the prevention of relapses in ulcerative colitis as well as to determine their protective mechanisms\n\nStudy Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial Study Population and Number of Subjects: 70 patients with ulcerative colitis in clinical remission Duration of Treatment: 6 months Primary Endpoint: Patient relapse rate over 6 months Secondary Endpoints: Changes in: 1) Time to relapse; 2) Patients' quality of life during the study period; 3) Mucosal inflammation, measured by fecal calprotectin at baseline, months 1, 3, 6 or at relapse; 4) Partial Mayo score at the baseline and monthly, or at a relapse; 5) Laboratory markers of inflammation\n\nSubject visits:\n\nScreening Visit\n\nAssessment of inclusion of exclusion criteria\nObtainment of Informed Consent\nMedical History\nPregnancy Test\nPartial Mayo score\n\nVisit Month 0 (baseline), 1, 3, 6 (or at relapse)\n\nFocused Physical Exam and Medical History\nPartial Mayo score\nFecal samples for Calprotectin and luminal microflora analysis\nBlood and urine samples for metabolomic analysis, inflammatory markers and other tests specified in the appendix 2.\nDietary counseling\nQuestionnaires specified in the appendix 2.\nSigmoidoscopy (only at relapse)\n\nVisit at Month 2, 4, 5\n\nTelephone interview by the dietician\nPartial mayo score\nQuestionnaires specified in the appendix 2\n\nStudies to Evaluate Mechanisms of Action of the Alberta anti-inflammatory diet:\n\nCompositional changes of the intestinal microbiota in fecal samples, using pyrosequencing\nHost and microbial metabolomics in serum and urine samples using gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance\nEvaluations of inflammatory markers (fecal calprotectin, serum interleukin (IL) -6, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)."

              "BriefSummary":"The goal of the Strongest Families Finland Canada project is to help parents develop skills to strengthen their families and reduce disruptive behavior in their 4 year old children.",
              "DetailedDescription":"This project will have two phases, described below. The first part will be development of the web based program, the second part will be the implementation of the program in Finland. All participants will be recruited in Finland and all research activities will take place in Finland, by the Finnish Consortium. The Canadian Consortium will assist in funding and provide expert support.\n\nPart 1: Website development:\n\nThe Strongest families program provides evidence based psychological and behavioural interventions to families with children with mild to moderate mental health problems. Parents work through a handbook with exercises, watch instructional videos and participate in weekly phone calls from a trained 'coach' (paraprofessional) to provide support, respond to parents' questions and highlight the skills included in a handbook. The preliminary analysis of a Strongest Families effectiveness trial based at the Izaak Walton Killam Children's Hospital (IWK) Health Centre (Projects #2234, and #2654) and effect size reports from the IWK Strongest families Service Program suggest that Strongest Families is an effective treatment for Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD).\n\nStrongest Families is an adaptation of the COPE program. COPE is a large-group parent training program (average 25 families per group) that has been evaluated and used in many centres across Canada, the United States and Europe. It was developed at McMaster University by a team led by Dr. Charles Cunningham (one of the investigators on this submission). The groups use a coping modelling problem solving approach to skill acquisition which encourages parents to discuss the solution to common problems, collaborate in the formulation of child management strategies, share successes, and provide supportive feedback. Large group discussions may also provide more information regarding normal child development and a greater perspective on common child management difficulties than clinic/individual parent training .\n\nThe benefits for parents participating in COPE group sessions are many, but the burden of traveling to receive services can impede attendance, especially for families in rural areas. One solution to this issue would be to adapt individualized Strongest Families to a more accessible mode.\n\nWe propose to develop a web-based version of Strongest Families in preparation for a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) in Finland. All components of web site will be developed using a collaborative approach with active participation by all members of the research team. We will review each of the component as it is developed. We estimate a minimum of three rounds of testing for each component. The program will be evaluated using the user-interface so that we review the website and all its various features in a manner that simulates the actual parent experience. No qualitative or quantitative data will be recorded for this phase of the project. No participants will be recruited for this phase of the trial.\n\nThe web version of Strongest Families will have two components. First, is a personalized website that tracks and uses all activities and interactions to modify the Strongest Families intervention as the user progresses through the sessions. Interactions include questions, surveys, and polls which will be asked periodically throughout the program (for examples see Appendix A). Second, the parenting skills curriculum will be based on our Strongest Families program, an approach derived from programs developed by members of this team18,19. Third, parents , using pseudonyms, will participate in a discussion board/blog to exchange ideas. Pseudonyms will be chosen by the participant, but will not include any identifying elements.\n\nPart 2: Randomized trial (Conducted in Finland, no Canadian recruitment)\n\nThe centerpiece project will be a population-based RCT of high risk 4 year olds attending well-child clinics in Turku and environs. Families of children with behavioural challenges fort he last six months, scoring 5 points or more on the Conduct subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and with some perceived problems by the parent in the impact section of the SDQ will be offered participation in a 2 arm trial. All data will be collected in Finland and stored at the University of Turku. All forms/scripts/ measures will be administered in Finnish or Swedish. This project has been approved by the Intermunicipal Hospital District of Southwest Finland. The Canadian team will provide expert and financial support.\n\nTreatment Group: Families randomized to Web-Enhanced Strongest Families (described above) will receive the website program described above.\n\nControl Group: Families randomized to Educational Control will receive access to a static website with parenting tips as well as a 45 coaching call to review the parenting tips.\n\nRandomization: (1:1 treatment: control; stratified by sex). Randomization sequences were generated by a qualified expert at arms length to the trial using a random permuted block sequence generator then concealed the placements using a double envelop system labeled with sequential numbers. Study staff were blinded to placements until randomization was completed by a study staff delegate."

              "BriefSummary":"There is little evidence to guide the current use of Frozen Plasma. Despite this, over 260,000 units of frozen plasma are transfused in Canada annually. Based on the limited published data available, the pattern of practice for Frozen Plasma transfusions is highly variable and an important number of Frozen Plasma transfusions appear to be inappropriate. Given inappropriate use, it is inevitable that a percentage of patients experience unnecessary and potentially life-threatening adverse transfusion reactions. Current guidelines for Frozen Plasma offer little help in guiding specific clinical decisions as their recommendations lack sufficient clinical details. This lack of detail also hinders the utility of these guidelines to help monitor and improve clinical practice. Further research examining Frozen Plasma transfusions including an understanding our current use is critical to improve the utilization of this valuable and limited resource.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Objectives: We will (1) systematically review the evidence for the use of Frozen Plasma transfusions, (2) establish appropriateness ratings for all clinical scenarios for which Frozen Plasma is transfused, and (3) perform a 3-month prospective study to understand the current use and the appropriateness of use of Frozen Plasma in 12 Canadian academic centres.\n\nMethods and Analysis: Following a well established methodology to evaluate medical therapies developed at RAND/UCLA, the investigators will purposively employ different epidemiologic techniques to assess the current use and appropriateness of Frozen Plasma transfusions in Canada.\n\nFirst, we will undertake a thorough systematic review of the evidence for the use of Frozen Plasma across all indications.\n\nThe RAND modified Delphi methodology will then be used to determine the appropriateness of transfusing Frozen Plasma across a comprehensive set of clinical scenarios. A panel of 9 experts representing relevant clinical specialties will use the evidence from the systematic review to determine the appropriateness ratings (an ordinal scale of 1-9) for each clinical scenario.\n\nSubsequently, we will undertake a prospective cohort study of all episodes of Frozen Plasma transfusions (approximately 5000 episodes) at 10 Canadian academic centres (17 hospitals) using the appropriateness ratings. Trained research assistants will identify all transfusion episodes via the blood bank and perform a chart review to obtain demographic variables (age, sex, weight), clinical variables (diagnosis, coagulopathy, indications for frozen plasma transfusions, other blood product transfusions), and laboratory (pre and posttransfusion coagulation tests) information. These data will allow mapping of each transfusion event onto a specific clinical scenario rated by the expert panel and the assignment of an appropriateness rating. We will also determine the total number of patients and the number of patients for each of the largest user groups of Frozen Plasma at each hospital. The primary outcomes for the prospective cohort study, the proportion of inappropriate transfusions (appropriateness) and the proportion of patients transfused (overall utilization), will be initially examined using descriptive statistics. Using hierarchical modeling, a logistic regression analysis will be used to examine the proportion of inappropriate transfusions while controlling for indication, hospital, and patient factors. For the analysis of overall utilization of Frozen Plasma, a chi-square analysis will be used to compare the proportion of patients transfused in the largest user groups at the different hospitals. A secondary analysis will examine the dose of Frozen Plasma transfused.\n\nGenerated Research: From the systematic reviews, appropriateness ratings, and the results of the cohort study, we will have summarized the evidence supporting the use of Frozen Plasma, produced detailed clinical guidelines outlining the appropriate and inappropriate indications for Frozen Plasma and provided an understanding of the variation in use and appropriateness of Frozen Plasma. Each of these elements can then be used by hospitals in Canada and elsewhere to improve the current use of Frozen Plasma. Understanding of the variation in Frozen Plasma will allow for a framework to improve transfusion practice and identify those areas of Frozen Plasma use that merit the greatest attention for further research."

Canadian guidelines recommend a target for LDL-C of ≤2.0 mmol/L (or ≥50% decrease) after treatment initiation in high-risk patients. The recommended first line treatment is statin therapy. Available data clearly indicates that up to 50% of high risk patients do not achieve this important target because of statin inadequacy or intolerance leading to non-adherence.\n\nTherefore this program aims to provide further insights into the challenges Canadian physicians face in helping their high risk patients achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C."

              "BriefSummary":"Before deciding on treatment for patients with lung cancer, a critical step in the investigation is finding out whether the lymph nodes in the chest contain cancer cells. This is accomplished with a biopsy of the lymph nodes through the airway wall, known as Endobronchial Ultrasound-guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration. Guidelines require that every single lymph node in the chest be biopsied through a process called Systematic Sampling. However, emerging data suggests that the lymph nodes that appear benign on imaging and ultrasound do not need a biopsy. A proposed alternative to the inefficient Systematic Sampling is the simplified Selective Targeted Sampling of the lymph nodes, whereby only lymph nodes that look malignant are biopsied. This trial will evaluate the simplified Selective Targeted Sampling of lymph nodes and compare it to Systematic Sampling to see whether it is equally as effective in staging lung cancer.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Treatment decisions in Non-Small Lung Cancer (NSCLC) are reliant on a thorough staging process that includes imaging with Computed Tomography (CT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Systematic Sampling (SS) of mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs) by Endobronchial Ultrasound Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). Collectively, the results of these staging procedures dictate whether patients will be treated with surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. Current guidelines for SS through EBUS-TBNA mandate the biopsy of at least 3 mediastinal LN stations (4R, 4L and 7) in the chest, even if they appear normal on CT and PET scan. Despite improvements in diagnostic techniques and safety, LN biopsies remain onerous for the patient and costly to our healthcare system. SS is also unreliable, yielding inconclusive pathology results in 42.14% of cases, especially for Triple Normal LNs, which are LNs that appear normal on PET, and CT, and EBUS. In fact, SS results in mostly negative or inconclusive biopsies for Triple Normal LNs, which may be due in part to their very low probability (< 6%) of malignancy. As such, the researchers have proposed to replace the onerous and unreliable process of SS by a simpler Selective Targeted Sampling (STS) staging process. In STS, Triple Normal LNs will not be biopsied, due to the very high negative predictive value (NPV) of malignancy. STS follows the simple notion that only LNs that have the potential to be malignant should be biopsied, whereas LNs which are very likely benign (i.e. Triple Normal LNs) should not be biopsied."

The prescription of a treatment regimen was at the discretion of the physician in accordance with local clinical practice and label, was made independently from this observational study and preceded the decision to offer the participant the opportunity to participate in this study. Adults chronically infected with HCV, receiving the interferon-free ABBVIE REGIMEN, were offered the opportunity to participate in this study during a routine clinical visit at the participating sites. Follow-up visits, treatment, procedures, and diagnostic methods followed physicians' routine clinical practice. Data were collected at the following time windows: baseline, early on-treatment visit, mid-treatment visit (for participants with a treatment duration of 24 weeks), end of treatment (EoT), early post-treatment and 12 and 24 weeks after the end of treatment (representing sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment [SVR12] and sustained virologic response 24 weeks after the end of treatment [SVR24])."

              "DetailedDescription":"Stroke is a leading cause of disability in Canada and frequently causes hemiparesis (upper limb and lower limb weakness on one side of the body). Approximately one third of stroke survivors require physical rehabilitation to improve their motor and functional recovery (1). Although many strategies have been shown to be effective in promoting recovery after stroke, the uptake of evidence-based practice by rehabilitation professionals across Canada is variable. The aim of this project is to evaluate whether using an implementation intervention promotes use of best practices by rehabilitation professionals and leads to improvements in patient outcomes for individuals with stroke.\n\nThis project is a cluster randomized implementation trial for upper and lower limb interventions. Rehabilitation centres across Canada will be randomized to receive either an outcome-oriented implementation strategy (OOI) to facilitate implementation of the EIPRs or a process-oriented implementation strategy (POI). At the onset, rehabilitation professionals practicing in all centres will receive education in using best practice outcome measures related to stroke rehabilitation. All centres will be assessed for baseline adherence to the EIPRs. Centres in the OOI will receive \"usual care\" (i.e. passive dissemination of the written protocols and information about outcome measures). Centres in the POI arm will receive a combination of strategies to facilitate EIPR uptake (i.e., use of a local facilitator, practice audits with feedback, reminder systems and educational sessions). Following exposure to the EIPRs, all centres will document adherence to the EIPRs, and patient outcomes as assessed by the measures. An analysis of the costs associated with rehabilitation interventions and the incremental expense of a POI strategy will be undertaken. These data will be used to compare the OOI and POI centres with respect to the level of uptake and implementation of EIPRs and related expenses."

The Registry was designed to assess the feasibility of implementing personalized care strategies through automated high quality data collection and patient engagement.\n\nThe CIROC Registry was launched with inaugural focus on Cardiac MRI base phenotyping, however has evolved to encompass cardiac CTA and echocardiography. Clinically referred patients are engaged by automated, tablet-based tools to collect informed consent and deploy standardized patient health assessments. Standardized reporting of disease features are captured using bespoke reporting tools. All patients are prospectively followed for a period of 10-years using linkage to administrative health data, inclusive of ICD-coded events, laboratory test results, ECG and vital statistics."

              "DetailedDescription":"Obesity currently affects over 15% of the adult population in Canada. The economic burden associated with obesity is estimated at $4.3 billion or 2.2% of the total health care costs in Canada. Despite increasing recognition as a public health problem, clinical management of obese patients in Canada has received little attention. This study will collect information on the current status, characteristics and management of subjects with obesity. The design of the study will mirror real-life management of these subjects.There are three goals in this study: the primary goal is to document appropriate obesity management strategies aimed at reducing and maintaining a healthy body weight by participating primary care physicians and specialists. The second goal is to explore factors that determine patients compliance and adherence to anti-obesity medication when prescribed. Obesity management is currently not a priority in tertiary care centres in Canada. An exception being the Bariatric Clinic located at McMaster University, which is one of the few academic centers dedicated to obesity management in Canada. The primary goal of the Bariatric Clinic Substudy is to evaluate the management, compliance and adherence of patients seen at a tertiary care obesity clinic compared to those of primary care physicians and specialists."

              "DetailedDescription":"ENGAGES CANADA is a parallel study to the ENGAGES study which is currently underway in the USA. Due to the difference in practice models and types of anesthesia principles, ENGAGES CANADA is an important study. Delirium is a relatively common postoperative complication in the geriatric population, affecting 20% to 70% of surgical patients over the age of 60. Delirium manifests as confusion, inattention and the inability to think logically, and may affect the patient's postoperative healing and rehabilitation. It is associated with persistent cognitive decline, longer hospital stay, increased incidence of injurious falls, and increased mortality. Patients undergoing major cardiac surgery are at a significant risk of postoperative delirium. To date, there is no proven method to prevent postoperative delirium in this patient population and often delirious events remain unrecognized. Randomized controlled studies in diverse surgical patient populations suggest that intraoperative electroencephalography (EEG) guidance during general anesthesia may decrease postoperative delirium and adverse postoperative outcomes. Patients who experience postoperative delirium report persistently decreased quality of life and it is a risk factor for incident psychiatric disorders and psychotropic medication use. One potential key mechanism in the relationship between delirium and incident psychiatric illness may be the experience of dissociation (disturbed awareness, impaired memory, or altered perceptions) in the perioperative period in those who are delirious. The co-occurrence of psychiatric illness and delirium can put older adults at greater risk of negative long terms effect such as functional decline. This study will compare the effectiveness of two anesthetic protocols in reducing postoperative delirium and postoperative health-related quality of life in a high risk population.We expect that EEG-guided anesthetic management of patients during their operative procedure will result in improved health-related outcomes, specifically decreased incidence of postoperative delirium and improved postoperative mental and physical health outcomes."

Although all genotypes are distributed worldwide some are more common in certain countries and/or among certain populations.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Genotype 3(G3) infection is the predominant type in South East Asia (Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka). In addition, because of the \"promiscuous exposure\" to hepatitis C amongst injection drug users, it is not unusual for the latter to be infected with G3 as well. There are several subtypes of G3. Viral genotype has long been recognized as a major factor influencing the response to interferon-based therapy. Patients infected with G2 and G3 respond much better to current therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin than those infected with G1 and G4. Most studies have grouped patients with G2 and G3 together, with few published comparisons of rates of viral clearance between these two favourable genotypes.\n\nMore recently it has become evident that in all individuals with chronic hepatitis C, the presence of insulin resistance, with or without the accompanying metabolic syndrome, is a major factor which influencing the response to antiviral therapy in CHC.\n\nVery recently it has been reported and confirmed by several sites worldwide that specific polymorphisms of the IL28 gene are closely correlated with response to antiviral therapy in genotype 1 CHC. Interestingly, the polymorphisms were also shown to segregate according to ethnicity and may explain, at least in part, the marked differences in treatment response between different ethnic groups."

There are 2 dosage level used in this phase: 5E10vp and 10E10vp, and 2 dose schedules: single dose and 2 dose. According to the pre-defined adaptive design standards, the trial will moved from Phase I to Phase II. In the phase II portion, A total of 600 healthy adult volunteers will be vaccinated according to the dose-escalation design from the younger adults(18 to <55) to the older adults(55 to <85). There are 2 dosage levels and schedules used in this phase，and will determine a final dose and schedule by the end. Some cohorts in the phase II trial will be included in the subsequent phase III trial."

The tissue targeting is highly precise, minimizing collateral damage.\n\nThe overall hypothesis is that HIFU with Sonablate can safely, effectively and selectively ablate prostate cancer tissue, resulting in complete tissue necrosis, in patients diagnosed with localized T1c/T2a prostate cancer, with minimal morbidity.\n\nThe specific hypothesis is that the Sonablate has the ability to:\n\nCompletely destroy prostate cancer tissue, without causing damage to the intervening tissue, with a drop in PSA levels to <0.5ng/ml.\nResult in negative biopsies for evidence of viable malignant cells after the treatment (12 months if Nadir is not reached or PSA rises from Nadir)\nSafely treat localized prostate cancer patients, with minimal and acceptable adverse effects"

              "BriefSummary":"Living with diabetes and other chronic (ongoing) conditions is common in older adults. These individuals have poorer health and higher use of health services compared to older adults with diabetes alone. Programs that help older adults self-manage their diabetes and other health conditions benefit both individuals and the healthcare system. The McMaster University Aging, Community and Health Research Unit developed and tested a new patient-centered, community-based program (CPP) to improve the delivery and outcomes of care for older adults with diabetes and other chronic conditions. This 6-month program was developed in partnership with patients, caregivers, primary and community care providers and researchers. The program is delivered by nurses, dietitians and community providers. It involves in-home or virtual visits by nurses and dietitians, monthly group wellness sessions at community centers or virtually, and monthly virtual team meetings. Wellness sessions include exercise, education, and social support. Caregivers are invited to be active participants along with patients. The program was successfully implemented in Ontario and Alberta. Participants who received the program had better quality of life, self-management, and mental health at no additional cost from a societal perspective compared to those receiving usual care. To determine how the program can best help people, more testing is needed with different communities and groups of people. We will partner with primary healthcare teams (e.g., family doctors' offices) in three provinces to adapt and test the program in a variety of real-world settings. We will assess how to best put this program into practice and measure outcomes important to patients and caregivers so study results are relevant to them. Study findings will guide the development of a plan for expanding the program to reach and benefit more older adults with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Patients and caregivers will be involved as key partners in all aspects of the research.",
              "DetailedDescription":"The purpose of this study is to examine the implementation and effectiveness of the CPP intervention in new settings and populations to demonstrate widespread effectiveness and ways to adapt CPP for diverse population subgroups and primary care setting and community care contexts. Based on the investigator's previous work, we expect that the CPP intervention will result in a greater improvement in mental health and will be cost neutral relative to usual care because program costs will be offset by lower use of other health services. A cross-jurisdictional, multi-site implementation-effectiveness type II hybrid randomized controlled trial will be conducted. The trial will be conducted in two sites in each of Ontario, Quebec, and Prince Edward Island. Each of the six sites will involve a primary care setting and a community care organization. Study participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention or usual care group. Participants randomly assigned to the intervention group will be offered the 6-month CPP intervention in addition to their usual primary care services offered by their local diabetes education centre or primary care setting. The primary outcome of intervention effectiveness is patient mental health. Other health outcomes for patients and their caregivers will be assessed (e.g., depression, anxiety, use of health and social services etc.). Implementation will be examined in-detail through qualitative evaluations with providers, patients and caregivers. Engagement of patients and caregivers will occur in all stages of the research study. Qualitative evaluation of patients and caregivers as research partners will be conducted through annual evaluations. Patient, Public (e.g., caregivers, knowledge users) and Community (e.g., local providers/representatives) Research Partners will be engaged in the research study by way of the study's established governance structures: Community Advisory Boards, Patient Advisory Council, and Steering Committee. Qualitative evaluation of Patient, Public and Community Research Partners will be conducted to inform implementation of the CPP intervention at the local context and the potential for widespread implementation and scale-up. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations will be used to interpret study findings, and in the development of scale-up plans."

              "BriefSummary":"This is a multicentre, phase III, 2-arm, masked randomized controlled trial. The primary hypothesis is that oral bovine lactoferrin (bLF), through its antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, will reduce the rate of mortality or major morbidity in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Almost 3,000 very low birth weight (VLBW), <1500g preterm infants are born and treated in Canada annually. About 1,200 either die or survive with severe brain or lung injury, retinopathy, late-onset sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), each of which is associated with substantial risk of childhood disability.\n\nLactoferrin is an antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory iron-carrying, bifidogenic glycoprotein found in all vertebrates and in mammalian milk, leukocytes and exocrine secretions. However, most VLBW infants receive insufficient human lactoferrin (hLF) from human breast milk in the first months of life, resulting in suboptimal protection. Because hLF is expensive, bovine lactoferrin (bLF) has been considered as an alternate supplement to improve this suboptimal protection.\n\nLIFT is one of several ongoing trials using higher doses of bovine bLF in the VLBW population (120-200 mg/kg/d). If LIFT confirms a 19% reduction in the relative risk of its primary outcome, bLF will have a major impact, translating into thousands more intact survivors without major morbidity in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Europe and worldwide each year. As >90% of very preterm survivors at hospital discharge reach adulthood, this represents more than 19,000 life-years gained in Canada alone each year, one of the largest gains in intact survival in any specialty since neonatal surfactant and antenatal steroids"

The epidemiologic data will determine where public health strategies should be directed to prevent future eye injuries.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Currently there is no established database or recording system of eye injuries occurring in Canada. Estimates place the figure at approximately 100000 significant eye injuries occurring in our country every year. This represents a large public health and long-term disability challenge. Lost productivity of working-age individuals with vision loss amounts to $4.4 billion annually in Canada, part of which is due to eye injury. By recording the types, locations, and outcomes of significant eye injuries, it is hoped improved public health strategies may be established to prevent further ones. The need for such a database has been recognized by the Ivey Eye Institute, the Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB) and the Canadian Ophthalmological Society (COS).\n\nThe United States Eye Injury Registry (USEIR) has been in existence for greater than 20 years. Through their database they have recorded thousands of eye injuries which has led to public health interventions through their various ocular societies. They have also established a standardized reporting system and ocular trauma score which has improved diagnosis and prognosis of eye injuries. This system has been used in many countries as a standardized reporting scheme for eye injuries.\n\nIt is hoped that through a pilot recording system established in London a framework for a national reporting system will develop. The objective is to use the standardized reporting system of the USEIR to report Canadian eye injuries.\n\nThe time frame for outcome measures will be 6 months. The patients will be followed along for this amount of time to assess there visual outcomes. No further follow up after 6 months will be undertaken for the purpose of the registry.\n\nThe hypothesis is that by recording the type and outcome of eye injuries, a better understanding of mechanisms and location of these injuries in Canada will occur. Subsequent public health interventions can then be made in conjunction with the CNIB and COS to improve eye health in Canada."

              "DetailedDescription":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly emerging viral infection causing COVID19. Therapy is generally not given to persons who are not hospitalized.\n\nHydroxychloroquine may have antiviral effects against SARS-CoV2 which may decrease disease severity when given early. This trial will use a modification of standard malaria dosing of hydroxychloroquine to provide preemptive therapy for those with early symptoms.\n\nThis study is a continuation of NCT04308668 which looked at post-exposure prophylaxis (now closed) and early treatment in the USA (now closed, data to be pooled) and Canada (which continues in this study). On April 28, 2020 NCT04308668 changed its primary outcome to symptomatic improvement in the preemptive therapy arm. This study continues enrollment for the primary ordinal outcome of hospitalization; hospitalization with intensive care stay; or death.\n\nPeople in the participating Canadian provinces can help answer this critically important question. No in-person visits are needed.\n\nThe doses of hydroxychloroquine being used have been approved by Health Canada.\n\nThis trial is targeting the following groups of people:\n\nIf you are symptomatic with a positive COVID-19 test within the first 4 days of symptoms and are not hospitalized; OR If you have had occupational exposure with known exposure to someone with lab-confirmed COVID-19 within the last 14 days AND have compatible symptoms starting within the last 4 days;\n\nYou may participate if you live anywhere in the Canadian Provinces of Quebec, Manitoba, Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland or Ontario.\n\nFor information on how to participate in the research trial, go to:\n\nwww.covid-19research.ca"

              "DetailedDescription":"This prospective cohort study enrols consecutive adult deceased organ donors with a waiver of research consent and collects various data related to deceased donor care in the ICU from the time of consent for donation to the time of organ recovery. Clinical data includes donor characteristics, type of donation (after neurological death or cardiocirculatory death), resuscitation methods, cardiopulmonary monitoring techniques, medications, blood work, mechanical ventilation, diagnostic imaging, complications, and methods of death declaration. Various clinical data on deceased donors are collected prospectively from the time of consent for organ donation up to and including the day of organ recovery.\n\nThe Canada-DONATE study is designed to develop a national platform for future clinical trials in deceased donor care. The main objectives include:\n\nEstablish specialized organ donation research teams at participating ICUs.\nObserve, record, and describe ICU practices in deceased donor care (e.g., donor resuscitation, organ suitability assessments, death declaration) which are likely to vary by site, region and province and will be very important to inform clinical care protocols for future RCTs.\nEngage and work with ODOs from each province to foster data sharing and develop procedures to enhance efficiency in future RCTs.\nInvestigate the comparative effectiveness of various ICU interventions in deceased donor care to improve the conversion of consented donors to actual donors and to improve the number of transplants per donor.\nProduce specific knowledge translation tools that will serve in the future as clinical tools to enhance ICU care and research tools to facilitate RCTs."

              "BriefSummary":"A pervasive and persistent finding is the health disadvantage experienced by those in food insecure households. While clear associations have been identified between food insecurity and diabetes risk factors, less is known about the relationship between food insecurity and incident type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the association between household food insecurity and the future development of type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe investigators used data from Ontario adult respondents to the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey, linked to health administrative data (n = 4,739). Food insecurity was assessed with the Household Food Security Survey Module and incident type 2 diabetes cases were identified by the Ontario Diabetes Database. Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for type 2 diabetes as a function of food insecurity.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Globally, there are over 200 million people living with type 2 diabetes. Aging populations, steadily increasing obesity rates, increases in sedentary behaviours, and decreases in diabetes-related mortality signal that the global prevalence of type 2 diabetes will continue to grow.\n\nIn Canada, type 2 diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions and is the 7th leading cause of mortality. Over the last decade, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Canada has increased by 72%, with 11 million Canadians currently living with diabetes or pre-diabetes. This number is expected to rise to 13.9 million (33% of Canadians) by 2026.\n\nMuch of the body of literature concerning type 2 diabetes focuses on management and control. Research that is geared towards prevention focuses heavily on the modification of individual risk behaviours, while less attention is given to the broader social determinants of increased type 2 diabetes risk.\n\nHousehold food security is a broad measure of socioeconomic status that is not traditionally included in health research. Household food insecurity is experienced when there is uncertainty regarding, or disruption in, food intake or eating patterns by at least one member of a household due to financial constraints, resulting in inadequate or insecure access to food.\n\nFood insecurity has been identified as a significant social and health problem in Canada . It was first measured in 2004, where it was estimated that 9.2% of Canadian households were food insecure. The most recent estimate from 2014 indicates that this number has risen to 12%, representing 3.2 million Canadians.\n\nWhile there exists the perception that food insecurity leads to caloric restriction, food insecurity has been associated with lower nutrient intakes and consumption of a less healthy diet compared to those who are food secure. Prior evidence from cross-sectional studies has demonstrated that there is an association between food insecurity and chronic disease risk including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes.\n\nThough clear associations have been identified between food insecurity and diabetes risk factors such as dietary consumption, weight gain, and obesity, less is known about the direct relationship between food insecurity and incident type 2 diabetes. Moreover, limited studies have investigated this association longitudinally in a population-based sample.\n\nProspective, longitudinal assessment is critical as cross-sectional studies lack the ability to infer the direction of the relationship between food insecurity and type 2 diabetes. For example, the 'health selection' hypothesis has been studied, positing that a decline in health status may precede and ultimately cause downward social mobility and a decrease in income leading to food insecurity. Consequently, this theory presents evidence for reverse causation, by which poor health may precede financial difficulties, especially in cases where early age of diagnosis, and thus longer duration of disease, might predispose individuals to being in a food insecure household.\n\nCurrent estimates of the future health consequences associated with food insecurity are needed to inform health decision-makers of potential areas for upstream intervention to alleviate the burden type 2 diabetes places on the Canadian healthcare system. Data linkages provide a novel opportunity to study this relationship in a prospective, population-based sample. Accordingly, the objectives of this study are to estimate the risk of type 2 diabetes as a function of food insecurity in the Canadian population, and to investigate the extent to which this association may be mediated by obesity."

These guidelines are intended to protect sunbed users from overexposure to UV radiation. Overexposure is defined as \"exposure that exceeds the amount needed for vitamin D production and could lead to skin or eye damage. Acute overexposure induces sunburn.\" However, the effect of the recommended time exposure schedule on serum 25(OH)D response has not been characterized. Further, it is unknown if the maximum time exposures are required to reach and/or maintain optimal 25(OH)D levels. The aim of the current study is to characterize serum 25(OH)D response to regular sunbed use following the time exposure schedule recommended by Health Canada."

              "BriefSummary":"CFDI NATIONAL REGISTRY\n\nFabry disease is a rare, inherited, genetic condition due to a deficiency of an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A. This enzyme deficiency causes the small blood vessels to accumulate a substance called glycolipid. Without sufficient levels of the enzyme, alpha-galactosidase A, persons with Fabry Disease develop severe neuropathic pain, kidney disease, heart disease, stroke and/or premature death; often before the age of 60.\n\nFabry Disease is estimated to affect approximately one out of every 40,000 males and up to twice as many females in Canada. We do not have the exact number of persons in Canada who have this disease. A common problem in studying rare conditions is the difficulty in identifying the majority of people suffering from such a disease. Gathering their health information in order to better understand the natural disease progression and its response to treatment is difficult.\n\nEarly ERT studies involving humans had small numbers of subjects and the studies were of short duration. The results of these clinical studies did lead to approval of the therapy in many countries around the world including Canada. To date though, evidence of the usefulness of ERT and its direct impact on the natural course of Fabry disease has been limited, while its cost continues to be very high. As a result of these issues, there will need to be continued and long-term collection of information related to the effectiveness of ERT and other treatments to better document its true clinical outcomes in Canadian people with Fabry disease.\n\nThe Canadian Fabry Disease Initiative National Registry (CFDI-NR) is an observational, voluntary registry designed to collect outcomes data on Fabry disease from people living in Canada.",
              "DetailedDescription":"CFDI NATIONAL REGISTRY: Canada-Wide Patient Recruitment\n\nThere are over 600 people in Canada known to have Fabry Disease. For more details about Fabry Disease, please refer to the \"Brief Summary.\"\n\nThe goals of this nation-wide study are as follows:\n\nTo maintain an established national registry which will collect information related to the identification and monitoring of all persons with Fabry disease in Canada;\nTo determine clinical outcomes of patients with Fabry disease including those on treatment;\nTo determine if urine and plasma Gb3 and globotriasylsphingosine (LysoGb3) and their analogues can be biomarkers for Fabry disease and can predict clinical outcomes.\n\nData will be collected at baseline and every 12 months, as follows:\n\nMedical History\nPhysical examination\nNeurological exam\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) - an electrical tracing of one's heart rhythm\nEchocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart)\nHolter monitor\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or CT Scan of the head\nLab tests (including alpha-galactosidase levels)\nReview of current medications\n24-hour urine collection or a random spot urine test\nBiomarker samples\n\nTo date though, evidence of the usefulness of ERT and its direct impact on the natural course of Fabry disease has been limited, while its cost continues to be very high (approximately $300,000 CDN per year per patient). As a result of these issues, there will need to be continued and long-term collection of information related to the effectiveness of ERT and other treatments to better document its true clinical outcomes in Canadian people with Fabry disease."

              "BriefSummary":"The aim of this study is to disseminate the 2010 Osteoporosis Canada clinical practice guidelines, using a multi-faceted Knowledge Translation (KT) model, as KT aims to close the gap between knowledge generated from research and practice. The investigators' primary objective is to evaluate if this intervention can increase the percent of long-term care (LTC) residents receiving appropriate treatment for osteoporosis (i.e. treatment is considered appropriate for an individual over age 50 who has had a diagnosis of osteoporosis or a fragility fracture of the hip or vertebrae and those who have had more than one fragility fracture and is therefore considered high-risk). A secondary objective is to examine whether the intervention increases the percent of all LTC residents receiving Vitamin D equivalent to ≥800 IU/day.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Individuals who live in LTC are at high risk for osteoporosis and fractures, particularly hip fractures, which lead to pain and transfer to acute care. The investigators' previous work in LTC has shown that awareness and use of clinical practice guidelines in LTC are low. To successfully transfer knowledge, it is imperative to understand the needs of the LTC teams and to tailor KT interventions appropriately.\n\nInterventions which focus on strategies to overcome barriers and on new ways to deliver and promote the uptake of best practices that are specific to both the learning needs of LTC health care providers and the operational/organizational culture in LTC are greatly needed. Interdisciplinary teams who participated in the Vitamin D and Osteoporosis Study (ViDOS) indicated several process barriers that may hinder the proper identification and treatment of fractures in LTC. There is a need to educate Ontario LTC practitioners on the osteoporosis guidelines. The investigators' aim is to facilitate the uptake of Osteoporosis Canada 2010 Clinical Practice Guidelines, across Ontario LTC homes using the ViDOS multi-faceted KT model. Furthermore, the investigators will have a greater emphasis on the implementation of guidelines which includes risk assessment and appropriate medication use."

Vancouver, Canada) versus interrupted technique using 0 non-barbed delayed absorbable suture (PDS II™, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA).\n\n1.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVE - To compare laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy anatomic failure rates at 6 months post-operative follow-up using self-anchoring 1 barbed delayed absorbable suture (Quill™ SRS, Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Vancouver, Canada) versus 0 non-barbed delayed absorbable suture (PDS II™, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA). The investigators will also assess mesh erosion rates, costs, and surgeon satisfaction rates.\n\n2.0 HYPOTHESIS 2.1 Primary: 2.1.a. Attachment of mesh using the running technique with self-anchoring 1 barbed delayed absorbable suture (Quill™ SRS, Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Vancouver, Canada) will be faster than the standard fixation interrupted technique using 0 non-barbed delayed absorbable suture (PDS II™, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA).\n\n2.2 Secondary: 2.2.a. Attachment of mesh using the running technique with self-anchoring 1 barbed delayed absorbable suture (Quill™ SRS, Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Vancouver, Canada) will be less costly than the standard fixation interrupted technique using 0 non-barbed delayed absorbable suture (PDS II™, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA).\n\n2.2.b. Failure rates and mesh erosion rates for each technique will be equally low.\n\n2.2.c. Surgeons will prefer the barbed running technique over the interrupted technique based on subjective surgeon satisfaction questionnaires."

The inhibition of estrogen in the breast by letrozole might help better identifying of suspicious areas in the breast and could assist radiologists in distinguishing between benign breast areas and cancer tissue. This might help reducing the rate of call backs and unnecessary biopsies for patients. We expect to enroll 20 healthy postmenopausal women in this study.",

A second MRI will be performed within a month and following administration of letrozole 12.5 mg daily for three days to reduce breast estrogen levels and in anticipation of lowering breast gadolinium dye uptake."

              "DetailedDescription":"Discrepant data exists about the quality of colonoscopies performed by family physicians and general internists. Currently in Canada, gastroenterologists and general surgeons perform 97% of the colonoscopies, but excessive wait times highlight a shortage of colonoscopists in Canada. This shortage will invariably worsen as our population ages and more Canadians become screened for colorectal cancer.\n\nOne method of improving this relative shortage of colonoscopists is through training primary care physicians in GI medicine and endoscopy. In order these physicians to be a legitimate option in the provision of colonoscopies; however, it must be shown that, as a group, they are able to meet benchmarks in colonoscopy competency.\n\nThis multi-centre observational study will be the first study to prospectively analyze colonoscopic examinations performed by primary care physicians at a provincial level. Using primarily cecal intubation rates and adenoma detection rates, along with other quality parameters, this study will compare the results of Alberta primary care physicians to standard benchmarks in colonoscopy competency.\n\nData will be collected using case report forms completed at the time of the colonoscopy, reviewing the patients' colonoscopy pathology results and a post procedure telephone survey to examine patient satisfaction rates.\n\nIf this study demonstrates that quality benchmarks are indeed met, then future training of primary care physicians in gastrointestinal medicine and endoscopy would be encouraged to help address current and future colonoscopist shortages."

The PTMA system is intended to treat functional mitral regurgitation (MR) in a heart failure patient by a less invasive method than surgical annuloplasty with greater relief of symptoms than medical management alone.\n\nStudy Objective: Functional mitral regurgitation is associated with an adverse prognosis in the heart failure patient. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether PTMA is effective in reducing mitral regurgitation in heart failure patients and whether this reduction is associated with a moderation in the adverse progression of heart failure symptoms.\n\nHypothesis under Test: Reduction of the severity of functional mitral regurgitation from baseline, as defined by a composite improvement of quantitative echocardiographic metrics, can be achieved safely with the PTMA device and will be associated with a measurable moderation of adverse progression of heart failure symptoms and a moderation of the deterioration of exercise capacity."

              "BriefSummary":"For patients diagnosed with early stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) on preoperative computerized tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans, surgical resection is usually the preferred method of treatment. However, to be eligible for surgery, current guidelines require that the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes in the chest cavity. To evaluate these lymph nodes, the standard of care is to undergo an endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedure, where all the visible lymph nodes in the chest are biopsied (sampled) with a needle. Unfortunately, these biopsies are often inconclusive, especially in patients who have no evidence of mediastinal lymph node spread on pre-operative imaging. Currently, the standard of care mandates that inconclusive biopsies should be repeated, either through another EBUS, or through more invasive procedures. Repeat inconclusive biopsies are oftentimes inconclusive as well; leading to a vicious cycle of inconclusive results, a delay in treatment, morbidity for the patient, and increased costs to the healthcare system. To circumvent this issue, the investigators have developed, validated and published a 4-point score, the Canada Lymph Node Score (CLNS), which uses four features observed during EBUS to predict whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or not. Research has demonstrated that lymph nodes which appear benign on both CT and PET scan that also have a CLNS of ≤1/4 are almost certainly benign. As such, it is believed that these \"triple normal\" lymph do not require biopsy (or repeat biopsy).\n\nThe investigators are challenging the current standard of care in lung cancer, which mandates that all the lymph nodes in the chest need to be biopsied (i.e. Systematic Sampling) before surgery, by proposing that triple normal lymph nodes can be omitted, and only those with cancer potential should be biopsied (i.e. Targeted Sampling).To prove this hypothesis, a randomized controlled trial comparing Systematic Sampling to Targeted Sampling is required. A feasibility trial is proposed to determine whether this large-scale randomized trial will be possible."

              "BriefSummary":"Background: The gas mask is used to protect military and non-military subjects exposed to respiratory hazards (CBRN agents). The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the gas mask on respiratory patterns and indexes of the respiratory effort. Methods: We are completing our study with 14 healthy subjects to evaluate breathing patterns, index of respiratory efforts and blood gases. Seven conditions have been tested in a randomized order: at rest, during effort (on a tread mill, standardized at 7 METs for all subjects) and during induced hypoxemia with and without a mask (C4, Airboss Defence, Bromont, Canada). Airway pressure, inspiratory and expiratory flows were measured. An esophageal catheter was introduced at the beginning of the study to measure esophageal pressure (Peso) and calculate indexes of respiratory effort (PTPeso, WOB). SpO2 was continuously measured and capillary blood bases were drawn at the end of each condition. Each condition lasted 10 minutes, data of the last 2 minutes at a steady state were considered for analyses. Results: The preliminary analyses based on 10 subjects are presented here. Comparing the wearing of the gas mask and without, most of the respiratory index increased in the tested conditions (at rest, during induced hypoxemia and during effort). At rest, in 8 out of 10 healthy subject the indexes of effort were higher with the gas mask, a statistical trend was observed with the WOB (0.22±0.13 vs. 0.28±0.10 J/cycle; p = 0.059), the PTPes (101±35 vs. 122±47 cmH2O*s; p=0.21) and SwingPeso (4.4±2.0 vs. 5.3±2.0 cmH2O; p=0.13). During the effort, the respiratory index increased (WOB 4.0±2.6 vs. 5.6±3.2; p=0.10; PTPeso 406±211 vs. 606±65; p=0.04; SwingPeso 14.8±8.1 vs. 21.8±9.0; p=0.13). There was no difference for the breathing pattern and arterial blood gases data with and without mask. Data for induced hypoxemia are under analysis. We measured on bench the inspiratory and expiratory resistances of the tested gas mask (C4: inspiratory resistances = 3.2 cmH2O at 1 L/sec; expiratory resistances = 0.9 cmH2O at 1 L/sec). This may explain in part the increased work of breathing with masks. Conclusions: This study demonstrated an increase of the indexes of respiratory effort during an exercise with the gas mask. This study is the first to directly assess the indexes of efforts with esophageal pressure in this situation. Our results and method may be used as a reference for evaluating tolerance with different designs of gas masks.",
              "DetailedDescription":"The principal way of penetration of CBRNE agents is the respiratory system. The current technology of a gas mask has been used to protect the respiratory system as far back as the First World War. That originated from Dr Cluny Macpherson's initiatives whom was a Canadian military physician.\n\nThe military gas mask is part of the respirator classification but owes its specific features. Conventionally, the military gas mask covers a large spectrum of protection aspects and matched with their specific canisters. Consequently, gas masks are usually studied separately from other respirators and Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SBCA).\n\nThe gas mask design and its components may lead to these respiratory load issues. At rest and effort, what would be the impacts for the work of breathing and gas exchange? In order to avoid hypoxemia and hyperoxia, what would be the optimal means to restore proper oxygenation? We hypothesised: i. on a heightened WOB and the respiratory demands related to wear of the gas mask; ii. An occurrence of hypoxemia will be manifesting during a continuous period at both at rest and effort.\n\nOur goal was to measure the impact of the work of breathing and the gas exchange for a gas mask user. We also measured what was the optimal means for correcting the hypoxemia with a subject.\n\n14 Male Human Subjects participated in a comparison and single-blind randomized experimental study. That was approved by the Ethical Review Committee. All male subjects were in averaged age of 38.9±5 year old and a FEV1 4.60±0.70 Liter. A written consent was obtained for all the subjects prior their acceptance. No rejection happened during the recruiting. The eligibility criteria were: i. No significant cardiac and respiratory diseases known; ii. No epilepsy background; iii. No severe pathology requiring medication; iv. No pregnancy for woman; v. Face medium - size in relation of the gas mask. The exclusion criteria were: i. Refusals relate to wear the oesophageal catheter and for capillary punctures; ii. Claustrophobia; iii. Oesophageal wounds backgrounds; iv. No coronary background and stroke history; v. No face morphology incompatibility with the mask. Spirometry and usual health screening was also done before starting the clinical trial.\n\nDesign comprised seven 10-minute testing conditions split in two parts. Five were at rest and sitting on a chair: i. Baseline without gas mask; ii. Baseline with gas mask; iii. Hypoxemia without mask; iv. Hypoxemia with gas mask; and v. Hypoxemia corrected. Two effort conditions were programmed at 7 METS Effort Zone and were performed on Treadmill (Constant 3 MPH speed and 10% inclination). These were with and without the gas mask. Between the rest-condition a 5-minute wash-out took place while for the effort a ten-minute was applied.\n\nThree five-minute periods was followed to record blood pressure and pulse during the conditions. SpO2 was continuously measured with Free O2 during condition while the Massimo was employed also at the beginning both the inclusion and at the each three hypoxemia condition (Radical - Signal Extraction Pulse Oximeter). During effort, they were taken at each two-minute, starting at a zero starting point. Capillary punctures were done at the end of each condition.\n\nOur main measurements were the WOB performed with a continuous recording of Peso pressure and respiratory volumes. Software Acknowledge, version 3.9 served as acquisition data system and analysis were achieved with a 4.2 version and a free-trial WOB calculus system, named RESPMAT. That was obtained from Maynaud and al. [2]. As power source, we used a BIOPAC (MP100, Santa Barbara, Californie, USA, 200 Hertz), four differential sensors (Validyne : 1x MP45±100 cmH2O; 2x MP??±5 cmH2O; 1x MP100±100 cmH2O) and four Carrier D-Modulators (Validyne, CT-15,120 Volt, 60 Hertz, 5Watts, Model CD15-A-2-A-1).\n\nSingle esophageal catheter (Type Cooper, French caliber #5) and disposable pneumotachs were used. Lidocain spray and K-Y gel were applied during the insertion of the catheter. Its placement was done at 37.6±5.7 cm across the subject and a Mueller test was performed for each subject. In regard of spontaneous breathing, an Hudson mask was used while a C-4 Gas Mask with a canister was employed (Manufacturer: Airboss Defence, Bromont, Canada). Hypoxemia mixture was home-design with usual nitrous and medical gas and maintaining a FiO2 target at 14%. Prototyped Free O2 System was employed for the correction of the hypoxemia."

              "BriefSummary":"Many patients on hemodialysis have low levels of magnesium. Magnesium is needed to keep the heart, kidneys, and other organs working properly. Patients with low serum magnesium concentration have a higher risk of death, heart issues, muscle cramps and fractures. There are several reasons why patients on dialysis have low levels of magnesium-these include poor diet, medication interference, and the dialysis procedure itself, which leaches small amounts of magnesium from the blood during each treatment.\n\nOne way to make sure that patients on dialysis are getting enough magnesium is to increase its concentration in the dialysate. The investigator would like to do a randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of increasing the concentration of magnesium in the dialysate on the risk of people on dialysis dying or being admitted to the hospital due to heart issues. The investigator thinks increasing the magnesium in the dialysate will help patients live longer, have fewer hospitalisations related to heart disease and patients may also experience less cramping associated with dialysis.\n\nThis simple adjustment to the dialysis procedure can be done at little cost and may even reduce overall healthcare costs. If the investigator can show that increasing magnesium in the dialysate improves patients' health, then it could become the standard of care for all patients on dialysis.",
              "DetailedDescription":"Statement of the health problem or issue\n\nIn end-stage kidney disease, dialysis is needed to remove toxins and electrolytes that would otherwise accumulate in a patient's blood. The fluid used in dialysis, the dialysate, contains magnesium, and the lower the concentration of dialysate magnesium, the more magnesium is removed from a patient's body during dialysis. Understanding the optimal amount of magnesium to include in the dialysate is crucial as magnesium regulates more than 300 enzymes in the body and is vital to heart, muscle, and bone health.\n\nIn Canada, the dialysate is prepared by central suppliers and contains magnesium in concentrations of 0.38, 0.5, or 0.75 mmol/L. In the absence of clinical trial evidence, there is no consensus on what magnesium concentration is best, and all 3 concentrations are used today in Canadian hemodialysis centres.\n\nObjective of the project\n\nIn outpatients receiving conventional hemodialysis, to determine if providing a higher versus lower dialysate magnesium concentration (0.75 vs. ≤0.5 mmol/L) as a centre policy alters outcomes important to patients and their providers.\n\nOutline\n\nThis is a pragmatic, two-arm, parallel-group, cluster-randomized, open-label, multicentre, comparative-effectiveness trial that will be embedded into routine care in hemodialysis centres in Canada. Centres will be randomized to set the hemodialysate magnesium concentration to be 0.75 mmol/L or ≤0.5 mmol/L in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis at these centres will be followed for study outcomes during the trial follow-up period.\n\nThe trial is highly pragmatic to facilitate high intervention adherence and extensive uptake of the findings; pragmatic features include (i) broad eligibility criteria and a large representative sample of hemodialysis centres and patients, (ii) intervention implementation within routine clinical care delivered by dialysis unit personnel rather than researchers, (iii) follow-up of patient outcomes using routinely collected data sources, (iv) an intent-to-treat analysis using all available data, and (v) outcomes highly relevant to patients.\n\nWhat is unique/innovative about the project?\n\nThe investigator usually needs to study a large number of patients in a clinical trial to reliably understand the effects of a treatment. Normally, a study with 15,000 patients would cost more than $15 million dollars to conduct; however, this study will provide a reliable answer to the question being asked and cost less than $4 million. This is because the investigator will use data that is already being collected by the healthcare system. For example, when a patient is hospitalized for a heart attack or stroke, this information is recorded in a secure healthcare database. The investigator will be able to analyze these healthcare data at the end of the study (and link patient outcomes to the type of dialysis treatment received (i.e. treatment or control). This innovative study design means that the study will be much larger (but cost much less) than a traditional clinical trial.\n\nThis pragmatic trial includes all patients who receive chronic in-centre hemodialysis patients in participating centres. High-risk patients with multiple comorbidities, including cognitive impairments or disabilities, who are often excluded from trials because of their high-risk status are eligible for participation in the Dialysate Magnesium trial. By including patients from a variety of medical, ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds, the results of the trial should be broadly generalizable.\n\nWhat is the impact of the proposed research?\n\nFor patients with severe kidney failure (10,000 in Ontario and >2 million worldwide), hemodialysis provides a life-saving treatment option; however a tragic 20-40% of patients die within one year of starting hemodialysis. The dialysate is a critical component of hemodialysis, yet little evidence is available to guide its optimal formulation. Dialysate magnesium in particular has received little scientific attention until recently, with new research suggesting that a higher dialysate magnesium concentration may benefit patients. Outcomes that may be improved include mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, and muscle cramps.\n\nWhile it is possible to raise the concentration of serum magnesium through oral supplements, using dialysis to do this is simpler and safer. It has no additional cost, does not add to a patient's pill burden, is not dependent on an adherent patient taking their pills, and avoids the gastrointestinal side effects of oral magnesium supplements.\n\nIf the investigator is able to demonstrate that a higher dialysate magnesium concentration improves patient outcomes, this formulation can be readily adopted to improve the care of ∼2 million patients receiving hemodialysis worldwide."

              "BriefSummary":"Presently in Canada, 29% of deaths are due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), costing $20.9 billion annually. The investigators have, therefore, brought together an unique network of investigators at different stages in their careers with a range of disciplines (nutrition, cardiology, diabetes, imaging, physics, clinical trials, statistics, laboratory medicine, primary care, genetics, psychology, knowledge translation (KT), and epidemiology) and with international recognition , experience and connections, to undertake a multi-centre study which will test the ability of the dietary Portfolio PLUS approach over 3 years to reduce the progression of plaque build-up in the carotid artery as assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in individuals with hypercholesterolemia.\n\nThe dietary portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods (viscous fibres, soy protein, plant sterol and nuts) which has been proven in many of their studies to be an effective cholesterol-lowering diet will be further enhanced by increased levels of monounsaturated fats (MUFA) and low glycemic index foods. Will this enhanced dietary strategy (dietary Portfolio PLUS ) reduce the progression of carotid atheromatous lesions, LDL-C and blood pressure while reducing the number of hyperlipidemic individuals requiring statins?",
              "DetailedDescription":"As Western populations age and as body weight increases, the need for dietary strategies to reduce Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) risk continues. The investigators are now in a position to put together a dietary approach which will be a significant advance over current dietary advice for CHD risk reduction. The investigators believe this study using imaging and functional techniques is now needed to 1) demonstrate an improvement in estimated CHD risk based on anatomical changes rather than serum risk factors. 2) encourage popular uptake and clinical use of this combination dietary strategy and 3) stimulate a larger longer term trial with CHD events.\n\nParticipants for this study will be recruited in 4 academic centres across Canada (Quebec, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver). They will be in the low or moderate risk category based on the current Canadian Cardiovascular Society's (CCS) Guidelines 2012 and would normally be considered for initial treatment with lifestyle only. All participants will first be screened by ultrasound for the presence of plaque in the carotid arteries and will then be randomized to one of the 2 treatment arms: Portfolio Plus diet (test) or modified DASH diet (control), both given as routine clinical advice with follow up visits at 3-month intervals for 6 months and then twice yearly for the remainder of the 3 year trial.\n\nPrior to starting either diet, participants will undergo screening ultrasound examination of both right and left carotids to enable selection of those individuals whose intima-media thickness would be 5-30% below the cut point considered by the Mannheim Consensus as relevant arterial thickening to ensure a relatively low risk group, yet with some measurable arterial thickening. The main outcome will be MRI assessment of maximum vessel wall volume. This assessment will be repeated at year 3. It will be emphasized at the outset that both the dietary portfolio and the DASH-like diets have been associated with benefits in terms of cholesterol reduction to provide equal encouragement for those randomized to the test and control groups. Portfolio and DASH-like dietary advice will consist of half hour individual sessions with the dietitian at baseline, 3, and 6 months and then at 6-month intervals. Prior to starting each diet, instruction will be given on achieving the dietary goals.\n\nAt follow-up visits, the participants' completed 7-day diet records will be discussed and the original advice reinforced. Every effort will be made to obtain study blood samples and carotid imaging data from all subjects at the designated times regardless of adherence to the dietary aspects of the study protocol. All subjects will be included in the intention-to-treat analysis."

              "BriefSummary":"Rotavirus Hospital Admissions Surveillance\nRetrospective surveillance for 2010 and 2011 for hospital admissions in children aged 0 to 16 years due to rotavirus gastroenteritis will be completed by all centers of the IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program, ACTive) pediatric hospital network.\nProspective surveillance of rotavirus-related admissions for children aged 0 to 16 years was conducted in 2012-19 inclusive and will be performed for an additional 1 year in 2020 at all 12 sites. Surveillance methodology will continue using the same case-finding strategy and the same case report form as in past surveillance (Case reporting is done electronically.\nEmergency Department Burden of Disease Case finding for all-cause diarrheal illness using ICD codes was undertaken prospectively for 2012 to 2014 and will not continue in the years 2015-17 inclusive. Systematic stool sampling was carried out for cases of gastroenteritis in children < 5 years of age presenting to the ED departments at the IMPACT hospitals in 2012 and 2013 and 5 of the 12 center hospitals in 2014. This component will not continue in to the 2015-17 protocol study years. However the admitted cases presenting to the IMPACT center hospitals with positive rotavirus will be reported and stool samples saved for genotyping at a later date.",
              "DetailedDescription":"This study has the ability to provide contemporary Canadian data on the two of the most important outcome measures for effectiveness of rotavirus vaccine: hospital admissions and emergency department visits. The extended time period that already exists prior to vaccine implementation (2005 to 2017) will provide longterm baseline data with which to compare disease burden from 2012 to 2020.\n\nThe major advantages to this study are that surveillance occurs at the same hospitals and the same methodology and CRF has been used since 2005. This will ensure reliability and consistency in the surveillance study. The national data set captures patients from age group 0 to 16 years in 12 centers across the country. The retrospective and prospective studies will be in a unique position to capture all children admitted to the 12 pediatric hospitals in Canada. Since reliance on discharge codes alone may underestimate gastroenteritis due to rotavirus, laboratory surveillance coupled with medical record review will ensure the complete capture of the true disease burden. Data on the health status of children will facilitate the evaluation of children who are medically fragile for which rotavirus infections may be more significant."

              "DetailedDescription":"The purpose of this registry is to capture additional \"on-label\" clinical data of the CE-marked BioMatrix Flex™ (BA9™-Eluting) stent system in relation to safety and effectiveness.\n\nThis prospective, multi-center registry will enroll a total of 533 patients. The BioMatrix FlexTM has been studied in randomized controlled trials and has been granted the CE mark. The data have been reviewed by Health Canada and no further randomized trials were requested. Prior to marketing approval, Health Canada requested that a registry be implemented to provide data in Canada on 'on label patients' to supplement the data already available from the Leaders trial, conducted on 'all comers' patients. The registry follows the normal medical practice for drug eluting stents in Canada. 100% informed consents will be checked, and at least all Major Adverse Cardiac Events up to 2 years will be source data verified. All MACEs developing in the patient population will be adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee. The patients will be followed clinically for up to 2 years after stent implantation.\n\nA third party Contract Research Organisation, Centre for Innovative Medicine has has been appointed to perform site monitoring and project management.\n\nThe appropriate Data Management and Validation, Statistical Analysis, Safety, Monitoring Plans and guidelines have been put into place to address quality and consistency of data.\n\nA Clinical Event Committee (CEC) has been put in place for this registry, consisting of cardiologists not participating in the registry. The mandate of this CEC will be to review all Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE), to adjudicate and to classify them. In addition, and in order to protect study participants, there will be a regular review of all reported safety events by the sponsor Clinical Safety Officer and a weekly assessment of the incidence of the important risks pertaining to the registry in order to detect any safety signals.\n\nThe sites have been trained during the Site Initiation Visits on registry operations and analysis activities, such as patient recruitment, data collection, data management, data analysis, reporting for adverse events, and change management."
